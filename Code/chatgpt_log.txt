The post may contain the following:               - A topic that mentions configuration errors.               - Code that implies configuration errors.         If the post contains configuration errors, reply with 'yes'.         If the post does not contain configuration errors, reply with 'no'.         Include a short explanation for your decision.

Input: I am getting this error for pull:     Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref   'refs/heads/feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch' from the remote, but no   such ref was fetched.   This error is not coming for any other branch.The special thing about this branch is that it is created from the previous commit of another branch.

My config file looks like:  <code>[core]     repositoryformatversion = 0     filemode = false     bare = false     logallrefupdates = true     symlinks = false     ignorecase = true     hideDotFiles = dotGitOnly [remote 'origin']     url = <url here>     fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* [branch 'master']     remote = origin     merge = refs/heads/master [branch 'new-develop']     remote = origin     merge = refs/heads/new-develop [branch 'feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch']     remote = origin     merge = refs/heads/feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch </code>
Output: Yes. The error message indicates that the specified ref for the branch 'feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch' does not exist. This suggests a configuration error related to the branch. Additionally, the configuration file snippet provided shows the branch 'feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch' is configured to merge with the remote ref 'refs/heads/feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch', which aligns with the error message.

Role: Given a Stack Overflow post, classify if the post contains configuration errors.     If the post contains configuration errors, reply with 'yes'.     If the post does not contain configuration errors, reply with 'no'.     Here are some examples on how to check if a Stack Overflow post contains configuration errors:         Example 1: I'm using <code>Symfony 2.1</code> for a project and trying to use <code>FOSUserBundle</code> to manage the users.I am also following the documentation but i'm getting an error:  <code> Unrecognized options 'handler' under 'fos_user.change_password.form' </code>  Any idea? Thanks in advance!         Answer for Example 1: Yes. The post mentions an error related to configuration. The user is trying to configure the FOSUserBundle in Symfony 2.1 and is encountering an error related to the 'handler' configuration option. Therefore the answer is Yes.         Example 2: ECMAScript 6 introduced <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let' rel='noreferrer'>the <code>let</code> statement</a>. I've heard that it's described as a local variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword. What are the differences? When should <code>let</code> be used instead of <code>var</code>?         Answer for Example 2: No. The post does not contain any explicit mentions or code that implies configuration errors. It is merely asking for an explanation of the differences between the 'let' statement and the 'var' keyword in ECMAScript 6. Therefore the answer is No.         Example 3: I am getting this error for pull:     Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref   'refs/heads/feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch' from the remote, but no   such ref was fetched.

Role: Given a Stack Overflow post, classify if the post contains configuration errors.     If the post contains configuration errors, reply with 'yes' and include a short explanation for your decision.     If the post does not contain configuration errors, reply with 'no' and include a short explanation for your decision.     Here are some examples on how to check if a Stack Overflow post contains configuration errors:         Example 1: I'm using <code>Symfony 2.1</code> for a project and trying to use <code>FOSUserBundle</code> to manage the users.I am also following the documentation but i'm getting an error:  <code> Unrecognized options 'handler' under 'fos_user.change_password.form' </code>  Any idea? Thanks in advance!         Answer for Example 1: Yes. The post mentions an error related to configuration. The user is trying to configure the FOSUserBundle in Symfony 2.1 and is encountering an error related to the 'handler' configuration option. Therefore the answer is Yes.         Example 2: ECMAScript 6 introduced <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let' rel='noreferrer'>the <code>let</code> statement</a>. I've heard that it's described as a local variable, but I'm still not quite sure how it behaves differently than the var keyword. What are the differences? When should <code>let</code> be used instead of <code>var</code>?         Answer for Example 2: No. The post does not contain any explicit mentions or code that implies configuration errors. It is merely asking for an explanation of the differences between the 'let' statement and the 'var' keyword in ECMAScript 6. Therefore the answer is No.         Example 3: I am getting this error for pull:     Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref   'refs/heads/feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch' from the remote, but no   such ref was fetched.   This error is not coming for any other branch.The special thing about this branch is that it is created from the previous commit of another branch. My config file looks like:  <code>[core]     repositoryformatversion = 0     filemode = false     bare = false     logallrefupdates = true     symlinks = false     ignorecase = true     hideDotFiles = dotGitOnly [remote 'origin']     url = <url here>     fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/* [branch 'master']     remote = origin     merge = refs/heads/master [branch 'new-develop']     remote = origin     merge = refs/heads/new-develop [branch 'feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch']     remote = origin     merge = refs/heads/feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch </code>         Answer for Example 3: Yes. The error message indicates that the specified ref for the branch 'feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch' does not exist. This suggests a configuration error related to the branch. Additionally, the configuration file snippet provided shows the branch 'feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch' is configured to merge with the remote ref 'refs/heads/feature/Sprint4/ABC-123-Branch', which aligns with the error message. Therefore, it is likely that the post is discussing a configuration error. Therefore the answer is Yes.         Example 4: Suppose I'm familiar with developing client-side applications in <a href='http://jquery.com/' rel='noreferrer'>jQuery</a>, but now I'd like to start using <a href='http://angularjs.org/' rel='noreferrer'>AngularJS</a>. Can you describe the paradigm shift that is necessary? Here are a few questions that might help you frame an answer:  <ul> <li>How do I architect and design client-side web applications differently? What is the biggest difference?</li> <li>What should I stop doing/using; What should I start doing/using instead?</li> <li>Are there any server-side considerations/restrictions?</li> </ul>  I'm not looking for a detailed comparison between <code>jQuery</code> and <code>AngularJS</code>.         Answer for Example 4: No. The post does not mention any configuration errors. It is asking for a description of the paradigm shift necessary when transitioning from jQuery to AngularJS. There is no code present that implies any configuration errors. Therefore the answer is No.         Example 5: 

Input: I'm trying to add a simple configuration to a SSIS package, of type SQL Server, so stored in a table. At the end of the wizard, when it goes to try and write a new row to the nominated table to store the configuration it fails with the error:</p>  <p>TITLE: Microsoft Visual Studio<br> Could not complete wizard actions.<br> Cannot retrieve configuration table schema. (Microsoft.DataTransformationServices.Wizards)</p>  <p>I can't seem to resolve this. The configuration connection has full permissions on the table, and it sees it and can read from it as it reports there is no current data for the filter I provide. It just wont write to it. A Google search of the error message above in quotes returns literally no hits! Any suggestions? Glenn
Output: Yes. The post mentions an error while trying to add a configuration to an SSIS package. Specifically, the error message indicates that the wizard is unable to retrieve the configuration table schema and therefore cannot complete the necessary actions. This suggests a configuration error related to accessing the table for storing the configuration. Therefore the answer is Yes.

Role: Given a Stack Overflow post, classify if the post contains configuration errors.     Here are two examples of Stack Overflow posts that contain configuration errors:         First Example: <p>I am trying to run a system deployed on a linux machine - built over jboss. I have ran jboss services but it is constantly giving these two errors:</p>  <p>When I try to open home page: <a href='http://localhost/' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>http://localhost/</a>  - it gives following errors:</p>  <p>'[engine] standardhost[localhost]: MAPPING configuration error for request URI' and 'No context configured to process this request'</p>  <p>Can you please guide what I need to do to see proper home page, any help is highly appreciated. </p>         Second Example: <p>I am building an Azure Cloud service application in a TFS 2012 build definition.  Everything is working properly with the default <strong>Cloud</strong> configuration.  However when I set the <code>TargetProfile</code> property in the <code>MSBuild</code> arguments I get the following error. The service configuration file exists in the project and I am able to select within the project properties.</p> <p>Is there something additional I need to do to get the build to recognize the non-default configuration?</p> <h3>MSBuild Arguments</h3> <blockquote> <p>/t:Publish /p:PublishDir=\buildserver\builddrops\LocA\ /p:TargetProfile=CloudLocA</p> </blockquote> <h3>Error Message</h3> <blockquote> <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v11.0\Windows Azure Tools\1.8\Microsoft.WindowsAzure.targets (353): No default service configuration 'ServiceConfiguration.cscfg' could be found in the project.</p> </blockquote>     And here are two examples of Stack Overflow posts that do not contain configuration errors:         First Example: <p>When looking beyond the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development' rel='noreferrer'>RAD</a> (drag-drop and configure) way of building user interfaces that many tools encourage you are likely to come across three design patterns called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Controller</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Presenter</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-ViewModel</a>. My question has three parts to it:</p>  <ol> <li>What issues do these patterns address?</li> <li>How are they similar?</li> <li>How are they different?</li> </ol>         Second Example: <p>For anchors that act like buttons (for example, the buttons on the sidebar of this Stack Overflow page titled <em>Questions</em>, <em>Tags</em>, and <em>Users</em>) or tabs, is there a CSS standard way to disable the highlighting effect if the user accidentally selects the text?</p> <p>I realize that this could be done with JavaScript and a little googling yielded the Mozilla-only <code>-moz-user-select</code> option.</p> <p>Is there a standard-compliant way to accomplish this with CSS, and if not, what is the 'best practice' approach?</p> ' OwnerDisplayName='anon' LastEditorUserId='365102' LastEditorDisplayName='anon' LastEditDate='2022-07-24T23:50:34.027     If the post contains configuration errors, reply with 'yes' and include a short explanation for your decision.

If the post does not contain configuration errors, reply with 'no' and include a short explanation for your decision.         Following the input, let's think step by step on how to find the best solution.

Outputs: 
Yes, the post contains a configuration error. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the XML configuration file "cfa-spring-context.xml". Specifically, the error states that the document root element 'beans' must match the DOCTYPE root 'null'. This suggests that there is a mismatch between the defined root element and the expected root element in the XML file.
Yes, the post contains a configuration error. The error message states that there is a "Child nodes not allowed" error in the web.config file. The code snippet provided in the post shows that there is a <compilers> section in the web.config file, which is not allowed as a child node. To fix the error, the <compilers> section should be moved to a valid location in the web.config file.
Yes, the post contains a configuration error. The error message states that there is an issue with the configuration file and it specifically mentions that the error can be caused by a virtual directory not being configured as an application in IIS. Additionally, the code snippet provided shows the authentication mode being set to 'Windows', which is likely related to the configuration error.
Yes, the post contains a configuration error. The error message "CS0103: The name 'MyConnString' does not exist in the current context" indicates that the connection string 'MyConnString' is not being recognized in the code. Upon examining the code and the web.config file, it is clear that the connection string is defined correctly in the web.config file. However, in the code, the SqlConnection object is being initialized with the string 'MyConnString' instead of the actual value of the connection string. To fix this error, the code should be modified to use the actual value of the connection string from the web.config file.

Method: Chain-of-Thought-Prompting
Role: The following input is a post from Stack Overflow. Your task is to classify if the post contains configuration errors or talk about it.         The post may satisfy the following criteria that indicate if configuration errors are present or if the user has a problem that indicates         configuration errors:               - The description of a configuration error by the user               - Description of causes that lead to a configuration error               - Methods used to detect/refactor specific configuration errors               - Discussion about tools for detecting and resolving specific configuration errors               - Discussion about the impact of a configuration error on software development               - Challenges identified in detecting and resolving configuration errors         Use these criteria to classify the post.         If at least one of these criteria is true, reply with 'yes' and include a short explanation for your decision,           such as the possible configuration error.         If non of these criteria is true, for example if the post is about configuration but not configuration errors, or the post is about a completely         different topic, reply with 'no' and include a short explanation for your decision.         It is very important to reply with 'no' if the post is vaguely about configuration errors, but the main topic of the post is about something else,         hence if the criteria are just vaguely met.

Note: 2 inputs exceeded length, worked with 495 in test set here

Role: The following input is a post from Stack Overflow. Your task is to classify if the post contains configuration errors or talk about it.         The post may contain the following information:               - A topic that mentions configuration errors, this can be the user talking about configurations and resulting errors, or an error                 reported by the user which can be the result of a configuration error.               - Code that implies configuration errors, either by the user directly stating the error or your knowledge on configuration errors for                 a given code section. Code sections in the input are marked with <code>         Keep in mind that the post is raw text and contains various html tags indicating different parts of the post, such as headings or code sections.         Here are two examples of Stack Overflow posts that contain configuration errors:             First Example: <p>I am trying to run a system deployed on a linux machine - built over jboss. I have ran jboss services but it is constantly giving these two errors:</p>  <p>When I try to open home page: <a href='http://localhost/' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>http://localhost/</a>  - it gives following errors:</p>  <p>'[engine] standardhost[localhost]: MAPPING configuration error for request URI' and 'No context configured to process this request'</p>  <p>Can you please guide what I need to do to see proper home page, any help is highly appreciated. </p>             Second Example: <p>I am building an Azure Cloud service application in a TFS 2012 build definition.  Everything is working properly with the default <strong>Cloud</strong> configuration.  However when I set the <code>TargetProfile</code> property in the <code>MSBuild</code> arguments I get the following error. The service configuration file exists in the project and I am able to select within the project properties.</p> <p>Is there something additional I need to do to get the build to recognize the non-default configuration?</p> <h3>MSBuild Arguments</h3> <blockquote> <p>/t:Publish /p:PublishDir=\buildserver\builddrops\LocA\ /p:TargetProfile=CloudLocA</p> </blockquote> <h3>Error Message</h3> <blockquote> <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v11.0\Windows Azure Tools\1.8\Microsoft.WindowsAzure.targets (353): No default service configuration 'ServiceConfiguration.cscfg' could be found in the project.</p> </blockquote>         And here are two examples of Stack Overflow posts that do not contain configuration errors:             First Example: <p>When looking beyond the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development' rel='noreferrer'>RAD</a> (drag-drop and configure) way of building user interfaces that many tools encourage you are likely to come across three design patterns called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Controller</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Presenter</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-ViewModel</a>. My question has three parts to it:</p>  <ol> <li>What issues do these patterns address?</li> <li>How are they similar?</li> <li>How are they different?</li> </ol>             Second Example: <p>For anchors that act like buttons (for example, the buttons on the sidebar of this Stack Overflow page titled <em>Questions</em>, <em>Tags</em>, and <em>Users</em>) or tabs, is there a CSS standard way to disable the highlighting effect if the user accidentally selects the text?</p> <p>I realize that this could be done with JavaScript and a little googling yielded the Mozilla-only <code>-moz-user-select</code> option.</p> <p>Is there a standard-compliant way to accomplish this with CSS, and if not, what is the 'best practice' approach?</p> ' OwnerDisplayName='anon' LastEditorUserId='365102' LastEditorDisplayName='anon' LastEditDate='2022-07-24T23:50:34.027         If the post contains configuration errors or talk about configuration errors, reply with 'yes' and include a short explanation for your decision,           such as the possible configuration error.         If the post does not contain configuration errors or talk about configuration errors, reply with 'no' and include a short explanation for your decision,           for example if the post is about configurations, but not specifically about configuration errors.

Method: Chain-of-Thought-Prompting
Role: The following input is a post from Stack Overflow. Your task is to classify if the post contains configuration errors or talk about it.         The post may contain the following information:               - A topic that mentions configuration errors, this can be the user talking about configurations and resulting errors, or an error                 reported by the user which can be the result of a configuration error.               - Code that implies configuration errors, either by the user directly stating the error or your knowledge on configuration errors for                 a given code section. Code sections in the input are marked with <code>         Keep in mind that the post is raw text and contains various html tags indicating different parts of the post, such as headings or code sections.         If the post contains configuration errors or talk about configuration errors, reply with 'yes' and include a short explanation for your decision,           such as the possible configuration error.         If the post does not contain configuration errors or talk about configuration errors, reply with 'no' and include a short explanation for your decision,           for example if the post is about configurations, but not specifically about configuration errors.         Following the input, let's think step by step on how to find the best solution.

Method: Few-Shot-Prompting
Role: The following input is a post from Stack Overflow. Your task is to classify if the post contains configuration errors or talk about it.         The post may contain the following information:               - A topic that mentions configuration errors, this can be the user talking about configurations and resulting errors, or an error                 reported by the user which can be the result of a configuration error.               - Code that implies configuration errors, either by the user directly stating the error or your knowledge on configuration errors for                 a given code section. Code sections in the input are marked with <code>         Keep in mind that the post is raw text and contains various html tags indicating different parts of the post, such as headings or code sections.         Here are two examples of Stack Overflow posts that contain configuration errors:             First Example: <p>I am trying to run a system deployed on a linux machine - built over jboss. I have ran jboss services but it is constantly giving these two errors:</p>  <p>When I try to open home page: <a href='http://localhost/' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>http://localhost/</a>  - it gives following errors:</p>  <p>'[engine] standardhost[localhost]: MAPPING configuration error for request URI' and 'No context configured to process this request'</p>  <p>Can you please guide what I need to do to see proper home page, any help is highly appreciated. </p>             Second Example: <p>I am building an Azure Cloud service application in a TFS 2012 build definition.  Everything is working properly with the default <strong>Cloud</strong> configuration.  However when I set the <code>TargetProfile</code> property in the <code>MSBuild</code> arguments I get the following error. The service configuration file exists in the project and I am able to select within the project properties.</p> <p>Is there something additional I need to do to get the build to recognize the non-default configuration?</p> <h3>MSBuild Arguments</h3> <blockquote> <p>/t:Publish /p:PublishDir=\buildserver\builddrops\LocA\ /p:TargetProfile=CloudLocA</p> </blockquote> <h3>Error Message</h3> <blockquote> <p>C:\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio\v11.0\Windows Azure Tools\1.8\Microsoft.WindowsAzure.targets (353): No default service configuration 'ServiceConfiguration.cscfg' could be found in the project.</p> </blockquote>         And here are two examples of Stack Overflow posts that do not contain configuration errors:             First Example: <p>When looking beyond the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development' rel='noreferrer'>RAD</a> (drag-drop and configure) way of building user interfaces that many tools encourage you are likely to come across three design patterns called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Controller</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Presenter</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-ViewModel</a>. My question has three parts to it:</p>  <ol> <li>What issues do these patterns address?</li> <li>How are they similar?</li> <li>How are they different?</li> </ol>             Second Example: <p>For anchors that act like buttons (for example, the buttons on the sidebar of this Stack Overflow page titled <em>Questions</em>, <em>Tags</em>, and <em>Users</em>) or tabs, is there a CSS standard way to disable the highlighting effect if the user accidentally selects the text?</p> <p>I realize that this could be done with JavaScript and a little googling yielded the Mozilla-only <code>-moz-user-select</code> option.</p> <p>Is there a standard-compliant way to accomplish this with CSS, and if not, what is the 'best practice' approach?</p> ' OwnerDisplayName='anon' LastEditorUserId='365102' LastEditorDisplayName='anon' LastEditDate='2022-07-24T23:50:34.027         If the post contains configuration errors or talk about configuration errors, reply only with 'yes'.         If the post does not contain configuration errors or talk about configuration errors, reply only with 'no'

I'm not sure I can describe this well enough for help... but here goes:</p>  <p>We have a .NET app to track our resources.  There's an export function to copy a resource to the time tracking system and the billing system; this accesses a stored procedure that links to the time and billing databases.</p>  <p>I recently moved the billing system database to a new server (original server: Server 2003 SP2, SQL 2005; new server: Server 2008 R2, SQL 2008 R2).  I have a Linked Server set up that points to the 2008 databases.  I updated the stored procedure to point to the 2008 server, and then I got an error about MSDTC and RPC (http://www.safnet.com/writing/tech/archives/2007/06/server_myserver.html).  I enabled 'rpc/rpc out' on the Linked Server and set MSDTC to allow Network Access (something like this: <a href='http://www.sqlwebpedia.com/content/msdtc-troubleshooting'>http://www.sqlwebpedia.com/content/msdtc-troubleshooting</a>).</p>  <p>Now I'm getting the above, when I try to run the export function: 'This SqlTransaction has completed; it is no longer usable.' What seems odd to me is that when I just run the stored procedure (from SSMS), it says it completes successfully.  </p>  <p>Has anyone seen this before?  Have I missed something in the configuration?  I keep going over the same pages, and the only thing I found was that I didn't reboot after making the MSDTC changes (mentioned in here: <a href='http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/adodotnetdataproviders/thread/7172223f-acbe-4472-8cdf-feec80fd2e64/'>http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/adodotnetdataproviders/thread/7172223f-acbe-4472-8cdf-feec80fd2e64/</a>).</p>  <p>I can post part or all of the stored procedure, if it would help... please let me know.</p>"]

Does anyone know if I am doing something wrong or how I should further troubleshoot this:</p>  <p>Here is my <code>config.yaml</code> I'm using to generate my <code>config.img</code>:</p>  <pre><code>#cloud-config network:     version: 2     ethernets:         ens2:             dhcp4: false             dhcp6: false             addresses: [10.0.0.40/24]             gateway4: 10.0.0.1 password: secret # for the 'ubuntu' user in case we can't SSH in chpasswd: { expire: false } ssh_pwauth: true users:     - default     - name: brennan       ssh_import_id: gh:brennancheung       sudo: ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL hostname: vm runcmd:     - [ sh, -xc, 'echo Here is the network config for your instance' ]     - [ ip, a ] final_message: 'Cloud init is done.

You can see how I'm running it here: <a href='https://github.com/brennancheung/playbooks/blob/master/cloud-init-lab/Makefile' rel='noreferrer'>https://github.com/brennancheung/playbooks/blob/master/cloud-init-lab/Makefile</a></p>  <p>NOTE: Once I'm logged into the box I can replace the config in <code>/etc/netplan</code> with the <code>network</code> section above and re-apply it and the networking comes up fine with a static IP.  So I think there aren't any obvious errors that I am missing.  This leads me to believe it is related to the cloud-init networking module(s) and not <code>netplan</code> itself.</p>"]

[False, 'no', "<p>I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>  <ul> <li><code>npm</code> & <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li> <li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which does it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).</li> <li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li> <li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li> <li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li> <li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. 'on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp').</li> <li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href='https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/' rel='noreferrer'>AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><em>Questions:</em></strong></p>  <ol> <li><em>What is <code>webpack</code> & <code>webpack-dev-server</code>?</em> Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. <em>What's the difference?</em></li> <li><em>Where would you use <code>browserify</code>?
