 How do I easily undo a git rebase? A lengthy manual method is:   <ol>  checkout the commit parent to both of the branches  create and checkout a temporary branch  cherry-pick all commits by hand  reset the faulty rebased branch to point to the temporary branch   </ol>   In my current situation, this works because I can easily spot commits from both branches (one was my stuff, the other was my colleague's stuff). However, my approach strikes me as suboptimal and error-prone (let's say I had just rebased with two of my own branches).   Clarification: I am talking about a rebase during which  <em> multiple </em>  commits were replayed, not only one.

 I've recently started maintaining someone else's JavaScript code. I'm fixing bugs, adding features and also trying to tidy up the code and make it more consistent.   The previous developer used two ways of declaring functions and I can't work out if there is a reason behind it or not.   The two ways are:   <pre>  <code> var functionOne = function() {     // Some code };  </code>  </pre>   And,   <pre>  <code> function functionTwo() {     // Some code }  </code>  </pre>   What are the reasons for using these two different methods and what are the pros and cons of each?

 Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's  <a href='http://www.jslint.com/' rel='noreferrer'> JSLint </a> , and it gave the following error:   <blockquote>   Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing "use strict" statement.   </blockquote>   Doing some searching, I realized that some people add  <code> "use strict"; </code>  into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.   So what is  <code> "use strict"; </code>  all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?   Do any of the current browsers respond to the  <code> "use strict"; </code>  string or is it for future use?

 Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!    <strong> Background: </strong>  We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.    <strong> Rationale: </strong>   <em> Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing. </em>  It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with StackÂ Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.    <strong> The Experiment: </strong>  Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e.  <em> "Use a transaction!" </em> ), I thought it best to write some C code and  <em> actually measure </em>  the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:   <ul>  A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the  <a href='https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-routes-and-schedules/' rel='noreferrer'> complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto </a>   My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.  The code is compiled with  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions' rel='noreferrer'> Visual C++ </a>  2005 as "Release" with "Full Optimization" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).  I'm using the SQLite "Amalgamation", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).   </ul>    <em> Let's write some code! </em>     <strong> The Code: </strong>  A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this "baseline" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:   <pre>  <code> /*************************************************************     Baseline code to experiment with SQLite performance.

We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)   <hr />   <h2> The "Worst-Case-Scenario" </h2>   We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:   <pre>  <code> sprintf(sSQL, "INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM); sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  </code>  </pre>   This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction.  <em> How slow? </em>    <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 9933.61 seconds   </blockquote>   Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only  <strong> 85 inserts per second. </strong>    <h2> Using a Transaction </h2>   By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:   <pre>  <code> sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r"); while (!feof(pFile)) {      ...  } fclose (pFile);  sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 38.03 seconds   </blockquote>   That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to  <strong> 23,000 inserts per second. </strong>    <h2> Using a Prepared Statement </h2>   Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use  <code> sqlite3_prepare_v2 </code>  to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using  <code> sqlite3_bind_text </code> :   <pre>  <code> /* Open input file and import into the database */ cStartClock = clock();  sprintf(sSQL, "INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"); sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &amp;stmt, &amp;tail);  sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r"); while (!feof(pFile)) {      fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);      sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, "\t");   /* Get Route */     sBR = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Branch */     sVR = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Version */     sST = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Stop Number */     sVI = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Vehicle */     sDT = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Date */     sTM = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Time */      sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);      sqlite3_step(stmt);      sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);     sqlite3_reset(stmt);      n++; } fclose (pFile);  sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  printf("Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n", n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);  sqlite3_finalize(stmt); sqlite3_close(db);  return 0;  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 16.27 seconds   </blockquote>   Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call  <code> sqlite3_clear_bindings </code>  and  <code> sqlite3_reset </code> ), but we've more than doubled our performance to  <strong> 53,000 inserts per second. </strong>    <h2> PRAGMA synchronous = OFF </h2>   By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting  <code> synchronous = OFF </code> , we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:   <pre>  <code> /* Open the database and create the schema */ sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db); sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 12.41 seconds   </blockquote>   The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to  <strong> 69,600 inserts per second. </strong>    <h2> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY </h2>   Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating  <code> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY </code> . Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:   <pre>  <code> /* Open the database and create the schema */ sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db); sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 13.50 seconds   </blockquote>   A little slower than the previous optimization at  <strong> 64,000 inserts per second. </strong>    <h2> PRAGMA synchronous = OFF  <em> and </em>  PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY </h2>   Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):   <pre>  <code> /* Open the database and create the schema */ sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &amp;db); sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 12.00 seconds   </blockquote>   Fantastic! We're able to do  <strong> 72,000 inserts per second. </strong>    <h2> Using an In-Memory Database </h2>   Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:   <pre>  <code> #define DATABASE ":memory:"  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 10.94 seconds   </blockquote>   It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform  <strong> 79,000 inserts per second. </strong>    <h2> Refactoring C Code </h2>   Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra  <code> char* </code>  assignment operations in the  <code> while </code>  loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of  <code> strtok() </code>  directly into  <code> sqlite3_bind_text() </code> , and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:   <pre>  <code> pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r"); while (!feof(pFile)) {      fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);      sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */      sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */     sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */     sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */      n++; } fclose (pFile);  </code>  </pre>    <strong> Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical </strong>    <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 8.94 seconds   </blockquote>   A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform  <strong> 96,700 inserts per second. </strong>  I think it's safe to say that this is  <em> plenty fast </em> . As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.   <hr />   <h2> Summary (so far) </h2>    <em> I hope you're still with me! </em>  The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go  <strong> from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second! </strong>    <hr />   <h2> CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX </h2>   Before we start measuring  <code> SELECT </code>  performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:    <strong> Create Index then Insert Data </strong>    <pre>  <code> sqlite3_exec(db, "CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg); ...  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 18.13 seconds   </blockquote>    <strong> Insert Data then Create Index </strong>    <pre>  <code> ... sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')", NULL, NULL, &amp;sErrMsg);  </code>  </pre>   <blockquote>   Imported 864913 records in 13.66 seconds   </blockquote>   As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second.  <strong> Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second. </strong>    <hr />   I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.  
 I need to match all of these opening tags:    <pre>  <code> <p> <a href='foo'>  </code>  </pre>    But not these:    <pre>  <code> <br /> <hr class='foo' />  </code>  </pre>    I came up with this and wanted to make sure I've got it right. I am only capturing the  <code> a-z </code> .    <pre>  <code> <([a-z]+) *[^/]*?>  </code>  </pre>    I believe it says:    <ul>  Find a less-than, then  Find (and capture) a-z one or more times, then  Find zero or more spaces, then  Find any character zero or more times, greedy, except  <code> / </code> , then  Find a greater-than   </ul>    Do I have that right? And more importantly, what do you think?  
 Can I ignore files locally without polluting the global git config for everyone else? I have untracked files that are spam in my git status but I don't want to commit git config changes for every single little random untracked file I have in my local branches.  
 Somebody pushed a branch called  <code> test </code>  with  <code> git push origin test </code>  to a shared repository. I can see the branch with  <code> git branch -r </code> . How do I check out the remote  <code> test </code>  branch? I've tried:   <ul>   <code> git checkout test </code> , which does nothing   <code> git checkout origin/test </code>  gives  <code> * (no branch) </code>    </ul>  
 Usually I would expect a  <code> String.contains() </code>  method, but there doesn't seem to be one.     What is a reasonable way to check for this?

 A C# desktop application (on the Visual Studio Express edition) worked, but then it didn't work 5 seconds later.   I tried the following:   <ul>  Ensure debug configuration, debug flag, and full debug information are set on all assemblies.  Delete all bin and obj folders and all DLL files related to the project from my entire machine.  Recreate projects causing the problem from scratch.  Reboot.   </ul>   I have two Windows Forms projects in the solution. One of them loads the debug information, one doesn't. They both refer to the assembly I'm trying to get debug information on in exactly the same way in the project file. Any ideas?   <hr />   I want to add here, mostly for myself when I come back to review this question, that symbols are not loaded until the assembly is loaded, and the assembly is not loaded until it is needed. If the breakpoint is in a library that is only used in one function in your main assembly, the symbols will not be loaded (and it will show the breakpoint as not being hit) until that function is called.  
 I am using Eclipse Android plugins to build a project, but I am getting this error in the console window:    <pre>  <code> [2010-02-03 10:31:14 - androidVNC]Error generating final archive: Debug certificate expired on 1/30/10 2:35 PM!  </code>  </pre>    How do I fix it?  
 In  <strong> SQL Server </strong> , it is possible to insert rows into a table with an  <code> INSERT.. SELECT </code>  statement:   <pre>  <code> INSERT INTO Table (col1, col2, col3) SELECT col1, col2, col3  FROM other_table  WHERE sql = 'cool'  </code>  </pre>   Is it also possible to  <em> update </em>  a table with  <code> SELECT </code> ? I have a temporary table containing the values and would like to update another table using those values. Perhaps something like this:   <pre>  <code> UPDATE Table SET col1, col2 SELECT col1, col2  FROM other_table  WHERE sql = 'cool' WHERE Table.id = other_table.id  </code>  </pre>  
 I accidentally ran  <code> git merge some_other_branch </code>  on my local master branch. I haven't pushed the changes to origin master.

 I have a repo (origin) on a USB key that I cloned on my hard drive (local). I moved "origin" to a NAS and successfully tested cloning it from here.   I would like to know if I can change the URI of "origin" in the settings of "local" so it will now pull from the NAS, and not from the USB key.   For now, I can see two solutions:   <ul>   push everything to the USB origin, and copy it to the NAS again (implies a lot of work due to new commits to NAS origin);     add a new remote to "local" and delete the old one (I fear I'll break my history).     </ul>  
 I have a class that contains an  <code> enum </code>  property, and upon serializing the object using  <code> JavaScriptSerializer </code> , my json result contains the integer value of the enumeration rather than its  <code> string </code>  "name".  Is there a way to get the enum as a  <code> string </code>  in my json without having to create a custom  <code> JavaScriptConverter </code> ?  Perhaps there's an attribute that I could decorate the  <code> enum </code>  definition, or object property, with?   As an example:   <pre>  <code> enum Gender { Male, Female }  class Person {     int Age { get; set; }     Gender Gender { get; set; } }  </code>  </pre>   Desired JSON result:   <pre>  <code> { "Age": 35, "Gender": "Male" }  </code>  </pre>   Ideally looking for answer with built-in .NET framework classes, if not possible alternatives (like Json.net) are welcome.  
 I am making the effort to learn Vim.    When I paste code into my document from the clipboard, I get extra spaces at the start of each new line:    <pre>  <code> line   line     line  </code>  </pre>    I know you can turn off auto indent but I can't get it to work because I have some other settings conflicting or something (which look pretty obvious in my .vimrc but don't seem to matter when I take them out).     How do I turn off auto indenting when I paste code but still have vim auto indent when I am writing code?  Here is my  <code> .vimrc </code>  file:    <pre>  <code> set expandtab   set tabstop=2   set shiftwidth=2   set autoindent   set smartindent   set bg=dark   set nowrap    </code>  </pre>

 Why does Google prepend  <code> while(1); </code>  to their (private) JSON responses?    For example, here's a response while turning a calendar on and off in  <a href='https://calendar.google.com/calendar/about/' rel='noreferrer'> Google Calendar </a> :    <pre>  <code> while (1); [   ['u', [     ['smsSentFlag', 'false'],     ['hideInvitations', 'false'],     ['remindOnRespondedEventsOnly', 'true'],     ['hideInvitations_remindOnRespondedEventsOnly', 'false_true'],     ['Calendar ID stripped for privacy', 'false'],     ['smsVerifiedFlag', 'true']   ]] ]  </code>  </pre>    I would assume this is to prevent people from doing an  <code> eval() </code>  on it, but all you'd really have to do is replace the  <code> while </code>  and then you'd be set. I would assume the eval prevention is to make sure people write safe JSON parsing code.    I've seen this used in a couple of other places, too, but a lot more so with Google (Mail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.) Strangely enough,  <a href='https://www.google.com/docs/about/' rel='noreferrer'> Google Docs </a>  starts with  <code> &amp;&amp;&amp;START&amp;&amp;&amp; </code>  instead, and Google Contacts seems to start with  <code> while(1); &amp;&amp;&amp;START&amp;&amp;&amp; </code> .    What's going on here?

 I have a script that works fine in one branch and is broken in another. I want to look at the two versions side-by-side and see what's different.

 In my  <code> ~/.gitconfig </code> , I list my personal email address under  <code> [user] </code> , since that's what I want to use for Github repos.    But, I've recently started using git for work, too. My company's git repo allows me to commit, but when it sends out announcements of new changesets, it says they are from Anonymous because it doesn't recognize the email address in my  <code> .gitconfig </code>  - at least, that's my theory.    Is it possible to specify multiple  <code> [user] </code>  definitions in  <code> .gitconfig </code> ? Or is there some other way to override the default  <code> .gitconfig </code>  for a certain directory? In my case, I check out all work code in  <code> ~/worksrc/ </code>  - is there a way to specify a  <code> .gitconfig </code>  for only that directory (and its subdirectories)?

 I have a requirement where I need to download a PDF from the website.

 Is there an SQL injection possibility even when using  <code> mysql_real_escape_string() </code>  function?    Consider this sample situation. SQL is constructed in PHP like this:    <pre>  <code> $login = mysql_real_escape_string(GetFromPost('login')); $password = mysql_real_escape_string(GetFromPost('password'));  $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE login='$login' AND password='$password'';  </code>  </pre>    I have heard numerous people say to me that code like that is still dangerous and possible to hack even with  <code> mysql_real_escape_string() </code>  function used. But I cannot think of any possible exploit?    Classic injections like this:    <pre>  <code> aaa' OR 1=1 --  </code>  </pre>    do not work.    Do you know of any possible injection that would get through the PHP code above?  
 How do I remove a specific value from an array? Something like:   <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'>  <code> array.remove(value);  </code>  </pre>   Constraints: I have to use  <strong> core </strong>  JavaScript. Frameworks are not allowed.  
 I have been working on a few Node apps, and I've been looking for a good pattern of storing deployment-related settings. In the Django world (where I come from), the common practise would be to have a  <code> settings.py </code>  file containing the standard settings (timezone, etc), and then a  <code> local_settings.py </code>  for deployment specific settings, ie. what database to talk to, what memcache socket, e-mail address for the admins and so on.    I have been looking for similar patterns for Node. Just a config file would be nice, so it does not have to be jammed in with everything else in  <code> app.js </code> , but I find it important to have a way to have server-specific configuration in a file that is not in source control. The same app could well be deployed across different servers with wildly different settings, and having to deal with merge conflicts and all that is not my idea of fun.    So is there some kind of framework/tool for this, or does everyone just hack something together themselves?

 I create a new branch in Git:    <pre>  <code> git branch my_branch  </code>  </pre>    Push it:    <pre>  <code> git push origin my_branch  </code>  </pre>    Now say someone made some changes on the server and I want to pull from  <code> origin/my_branch </code> . I do:    <pre>  <code> git pull  </code>  </pre>    But I get:    <pre>  <code> You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you want to merge with, and 'branch.my_branch.merge' in your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please specify which branch you want to use on the command line and try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>'). See git-pull(1) for details.  If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to use something like the following in your configuration file:      [branch 'my_branch']     remote = <nickname>     merge = <remote-ref>      [remote '<nickname>']     url = <url>     fetch = <refspec>  See git-config(1) for details.  </code>  </pre>    I learned that I can make it work with:    <pre>  <code> git branch --set-upstream my_branch origin/my_branch  </code>  </pre>    But why do I need to do this for every branch I create? Isn't it obvious that if I push  <code> my_branch </code>  into  <code> origin/my_branch </code> , then I would want to pull  <code> origin/my_branch </code>  into  <code> my_branch </code> ? How can I make this the default behavior?

Or does the annotation also influence the behavior and functionality of the class?

I have added a  <code> .gitignore </code>  file to my home directory ( <code> /Users/me/ </code> ) and I have added the following line to it:    <pre>  <code> *.tmproj  </code>  </pre>    But it is not ignoring this type of files, any idea what I am doing wrong?  
 I'm learning Spring 3 and I don't seem to grasp the functionality behind  <code> <context:annotation-config> </code>  and  <code> <context:component-scan> </code> .    From what I've read they seem to handle different  <em> annotations </em>  ( <code> @Required </code> ,  <code> @Autowired </code>  etc vs  <code> @Component </code> ,  <code> @Repository </code> ,  <code> @Service </code>  etc), but also from what I've read they register the same  <em> bean post processor </em>  classes.    To confuse me even more, there is an  <code> annotation-config </code>   <em> attribute </em>  on  <code> <context:component-scan> </code> .    Can someone shed some light on these tags? What's similar, what's different, is one superseded by the other, they complete each other, do I need one of them, both?  
 If I have a MySQL table looking something like this:    <pre>  company_name    action  pagecount ------------------------------- Company A       PRINT   3 Company A       PRINT   2 Company A       PRINT   3 Company B       EMAIL    Company B       PRINT   2 Company B       PRINT   2 Company B       PRINT   1 Company A       PRINT   3  </pre>    Is it possible to run a MySQL query to get output like this:    <pre>  company_name    EMAIL   PRINT 1 pages   PRINT 2 pages   PRINT 3 pages ------------------------------------------------------------- CompanyA        0       0               1               3 CompanyB        1       1               2               0  </pre>    The idea is that  <code> pagecount </code>  can vary so the output column amount should reflect that, one column for each  <code> action </code> / <code> pagecount </code>  pair and then number of hits per  <code> company_name </code> . I'm not sure if this is called a pivot table but someone suggested that?  
 I have this table for documents (simplified version here):   <div class='s-table-container'>   <table class='s-table'>   <thead>   <tr>   <th> id </th>   <th> rev </th>   <th> content </th>   </tr>   </thead>   <tbody>   <tr>   <td> 1 </td>   <td> 1 </td>   <td> ... </td>   </tr>   <tr>   <td> 2 </td>   <td> 1 </td>   <td> ... </td>   </tr>   <tr>   <td> 1 </td>   <td> 2 </td>   <td> ... </td>   </tr>   <tr>   <td> 1 </td>   <td> 3 </td>   <td> ... </td>   </tr>   </tbody>   </table>   </div>   How do I select one row per id and only the greatest rev? <br />  With the above data, the result should contain two rows:  <code> [1, 3, ...] </code>  and  <code> [2, 1, ..] </code> . I'm using  <em>  <strong> MySQL </strong>  </em> .   Currently I use checks in the  <code> while </code>  loop to detect and over-write old revs from the resultset. But is this the only method to achieve the result? Isn't there a  <strong> SQL </strong>  solution?  
 Why do certain random strings produce colors when entered as background colors in HTML?   For example,  <code> bgcolor="chucknorris" </code>  produces a  <strong> red background </strong> :    <div class='snippet' data-lang='js' data-hide='false' data-console='false' data-babel='false'>   <div class='snippet-code'>   <pre class='snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override'>  <code> <body bgcolor='chucknorris'> test </body> </code>  </pre>   </div>   </div>     Conversely,   <code> bgcolor="chucknorr" </code>  produces a  <strong> yellow background </strong> :    <div class='snippet' data-lang='js' data-hide='false' data-console='false' data-babel='false'>   <div class='snippet-code'>   <pre class='snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override'>  <code> <body bgcolor='chucknorr'> test </body> </code>  </pre>   </div>   </div>     This holds true across various browsers and platforms. Whatâs going on here?  
  <code> .gitconfig </code>  is usually stored in the  <code> user.home </code>  directory.    I use a different identity to work on projects for Company A and something else for Company B (primarily the name / email). How can I have two different Git configurations so that my check-ins don't go with the name / email?  
 I wrote some code for testing the impact of try-catch, but seeing some surprising results.    <pre>  <code> static void Main(string[] args) {     Thread.CurrentThread.Priority = ThreadPriority.Highest;     Process.GetCurrentProcess().PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime;      long start = 0, stop = 0, elapsed = 0;     double avg = 0.0;      long temp = Fibo(1);      for (int i = 1; i < 100000000; i++)     {         start = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();         temp = Fibo(100);         stop = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();          elapsed = stop - start;         avg = avg + ((double)elapsed - avg) / i;     }      Console.WriteLine('Elapsed: ' + avg);     Console.ReadKey(); }  static long Fibo(int n) {     long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;     n++;      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)     {         n1 = n2;         n2 = fibo;         fibo = n1 + n2;     }      return fibo; }  </code>  </pre>    On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..    When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:    <pre>  <code> static long Fibo(int n) {     long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;     n++;      try     {         for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)         {             n1 = n2;             n2 = fibo;             fibo = n1 + n2;         }     }     catch {}      return fibo; }  </code>  </pre>    Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?    Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).    EDIT:  <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/8928476/282110'> Jon Skeet's  <em> excellent </em>  analysis </a>  shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using  <code> int </code>  types inside the Fibo method instead of  <code> long </code>  types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.    <hr>     <strong> UPDATE: </strong>  It looks like this issue has been fixed by Roslyn. Same machine, same CLR version -- the issue remains as above when compiled with VS 2013, but the problem goes away when compiled with VS 2015.   
 How can I loop through all the entries in an array using JavaScript?  
 Is it possible to configure  <code> ssh </code>  to know what my username should be?    By default it uses the current username, which is not correct in my case.    I'm on a loaner laptop, and my username is  <code> loaner </code> , but I want to tell  <code> ssh </code>  that my username is  <code> buck </code> .    Bonus points: my username at home is bgolemon. If I could configure the username per-host that would be even better.  
 What are the material differences between the new  <a href='https://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/scenarios/web-sites/'> Azure Web Sites </a>  and the traditional Azure Web Roles for an ASP.NET MVC application?  What reason would I choose a 'web site' over a 'web role' or vice versa?    Let's assume that I would need equal capacity in either case (e.g. 2 small instances).  The prices seem comparable other than the fact that there is a 33% temporary discount for web sites while they are in their preview period.    Are there things that I can do with a 'web site' that are difficulty or impossible with a web role?  For example, does it become easy to put multiple web sites in a single set of VMs using 'web sites'?  Do I lose anything with a 'web site' vs a 'web role'?  Ability to fine tune IIS?  Ability to use the Cache service locally?  
 Here is a piece of C++ code that shows some very peculiar behavior.   For some reason, sorting the data ( <em> before </em>  the timed region) miraculously makes the primary loop almost six times faster:   <pre class='lang-cpp prettyprint-override'>  <code> #include <algorithm> #include <ctime> #include <iostream>  int main() {     // Generate data     const unsigned arraySize = 32768;     int data[arraySize];      for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)         data[c] = std::rand() % 256;      // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.     std::sort(data, data + arraySize);      // Test     clock_t start = clock();     long long sum = 0;     for (unsigned i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)     {         for (unsigned c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)         {   // Primary loop.             if (data[c] >= 128)                 sum += data[c];         }     }      double elapsedTime = static_cast<double>(clock()-start) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;      std::cout << elapsedTime << '\n';     std::cout << "sum = " << sum << '\n'; }  </code>  </pre>   <ul>  Without  <code> std::sort(data, data + arraySize); </code> , the code runs in 11.54 seconds.  With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.   </ul>   (Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)   <hr />   Initially, I thought this might be just a language or compiler anomaly, so I tried Java:   <pre class='lang-java prettyprint-override'>  <code> import java.util.Arrays; import java.util.Random;  public class Main {     public static void main(String[] args)     {         // Generate data         int arraySize = 32768;         int data[] = new int[arraySize];          Random rnd = new Random(0);         for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)             data[c] = rnd.nextInt() % 256;          // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster         Arrays.sort(data);          // Test         long start = System.nanoTime();         long sum = 0;         for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i)         {             for (int c = 0; c < arraySize; ++c)             {   // Primary loop.                 if (data[c] >= 128)                     sum += data[c];             }         }          System.out.println((System.nanoTime() - start) / 1000000000.0);         System.out.println("sum = " + sum);     } }  </code>  </pre>   With a similar but less extreme result.   <hr />   My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the  <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache' rel='noreferrer'> cache </a> , but that's silly because the array was just generated.   <ul>  What is going on?  Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?   </ul>   The code is summing up some independent terms, so the order should not matter.   <hr />    <strong> Related / follow-up Q&amp;As </strong>  about the same effect with different/later compilers and options:   <ul>   <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/66521344'> Why is processing an unsorted array the same speed as processing a sorted array with modern x86-64 clang? </a>    <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/28875325'> gcc optimization flag -O3 makes code slower than -O2 </a>    </ul>  
 I am trying to learn the best way to write queries. I also understand the importance of being consistent. Until now, I have randomly used single quotes, double quotes, and backticks without any real thought.    Example:    <pre>  <code> $query = 'INSERT INTO table (id, col1, col2) VALUES (NULL, val1, val2)';  </code>  </pre>    Also, in the above example, consider that  <code> table </code> ,  <code> col1 </code> ,  <code> val1 </code> , etc. may be variables.    What is the standard for this? What do you do?     <sub> I've been reading answers to similar questions on here for about 20 minutes, but it seems like there is no definitive answer to this question. </sub>

 I'm finding a way to aggregate strings from different rows into a single row. I'm looking to do this in many different places, so having a function to facilitate this would be nice. I've tried solutions using  <code> COALESCE </code>  and  <code> FOR XML </code> , but they just don't cut it for me.    String aggregation would do something like this:    <pre>  <code> id | Name                    Result: id | Names -- - ----                            -- - ----- 1  | Matt                            1  | Matt, Rocks 1  | Rocks                           2  | Stylus 2  | Stylus  </code>  </pre>    I've taken a look at  <a href='http://picnicerror.net/development/sql-server/concatenate-multiple-row-values-sql-server-with-clr-2012-01-10/'> CLR-defined aggregate functions </a>  as a replacement for  <code> COALESCE </code>  and  <code> FOR XML </code> , but apparently  <strong> SQL Azure </strong>   <em> does not </em>  support CLR-defined stuff, which is a pain for me because I know being able to use it would solve a whole lot of problems for me.    Is there any possible workaround, or similarly optimal method (which might not be as optimal as CLR, but  <em> hey </em>  I'll take what I can get) that I can use to aggregate my stuff?  
 I'm using Python's logging module to log some debug strings to a file which works pretty well. Now in addition, I'd like to use this module to also print the strings out to stdout. How do I do this? In order to log my strings to a file I use following code:    <pre>  <code> import logging import logging.handlers logger = logging.getLogger('') logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG) handler = logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler(     LOGFILE, maxBytes=(1048576*5), backupCount=7 ) formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s') handler.setFormatter(formatter) logger.addHandler(handler)  </code>  </pre>    and then call a logger function like    <pre>  <code> logger.debug('I am written to the file')  </code>  </pre>    Thank you for some help here!  
 How do I return the response/result from a function  <code> foo </code>  that makes an asynchronous request?   I am trying to return the value from the callback, as well as assigning the result to a local variable inside the function and returning that one, but none of those ways actually return the response â they all return  <code> undefined </code>  or whatever the initial value of the variable  <code> result </code>  is.    <strong> Example of an asynchronous function that accepts a callback </strong>  (using jQuery's  <code> ajax </code>  function):   <pre>  <code> function foo() {     var result;      $.ajax({         url: '...',         success: function(response) {             result = response;             // return response; // <- I tried that one as well         }     });      return result; // It always returns `undefined` }  </code>  </pre>    <strong> Example using Node.js: </strong>    <pre>  <code> function foo() {     var result;      fs.readFile("path/to/file", function(err, data) {         result = data;         // return data; // <- I tried that one as well     });      return result; // It always returns `undefined` }  </code>  </pre>    <strong> Example using the  <code> then </code>  block of a promise: </strong>    <pre>  <code> function foo() {     var result;      fetch(url).then(function(response) {         result = response;         // return response; // <- I tried that one as well     });      return result; // It always returns `undefined` }  </code>  </pre>  
 Yesterday I was pairing the socks from the clean laundry and figured out the way I was doing it is not very efficient. I was doing a naive search&nbsp;â picking one sock and 'iterating' the pile in order to find its pair. This requires iterating over n/2 * n/4 = n <sup> 2 </sup> /8 socks on average.    As a computer scientist I was thinking what I could do? Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution.    Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).     <strong> So, the question is basically: </strong>     Given a pile of  <code> n </code>  pairs of socks, containing  <code> 2n </code>  elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space? (I believe I can remember that amount of info if needed.)    I will appreciate an answer that addresses the following aspects:    <ul>  A general  <em> theoretical </em>  solution for a huge number of socks.  The actual number of socks is not that large, I don't believe my spouse and I have more than 30 pairs. (And it is fairly easy to distinguish between my socks and hers; can this be used as well?)  Is it equivalent to the  <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Element_distinctness_problem' rel='noreferrer'> element distinctness problem </a> ?   </ul>

 How do I configure the TCP/IP port listened on by a Spring Boot application, so it does not use the default port of 8080.  
 I am trying to build a shared library using a C extension file but first I have to generate the output file using the command below:   <pre class='lang-none prettyprint-override'>  <code> gcc -Wall utilsmodule.c -o Utilc  </code>  </pre>   After executing the command, I get this error message:   <pre>  <code> > utilsmodule.c:1:20: fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory compilation terminated.  </code>  </pre>   I have tried all the suggested solutions over the internet but the problem still exists. I have no problem with  <code> Python.h </code> . I managed to locate the file on my machine.  
 In Dockerfiles there are two commands that look similar to me:  <code> CMD </code>  and  <code> ENTRYPOINT </code> . But I guess that there is a (subtle?) difference between them - otherwise it would not make any sense to have two commands for the very same thing.   The documentation states for  <code> CMD </code> -   <blockquote>   The main purpose of a CMD is to provide defaults for an executing container.   </blockquote>   and for  <code> ENTRYPOINT </code> :   <blockquote>   An ENTRYPOINT helps you to configure a container that you can run as an executable.   </blockquote>   So, what's the difference between those two commands?  
 I'm thinking of using Docker to build my dependencies on a Continuous Integration (CI) server, so that I don't have to install all the runtimes and libraries on the agents themselves.     To achieve this I would need to copy the build artifacts that are built inside the container back into the host. Is that possible?  
 I'm experimenting with Dockerfiles, and I think I understand most of the logic. However, I don't see the difference between 'exposing' and 'publishing' a port in this context.    All the tutorials I have seen first include the  <code> EXPOSE </code>  command in the Dockerfile:    <pre>  <code> ... EXPOSE 8080 ...  </code>  </pre>    They then build an image from this Dockerfile:    <pre>  <code> $ docker build -t an_image - < Dockerfile  </code>  </pre>    And then  <em> publish </em>  the same port as above when running the image:    <pre>  <code> $ docker run -d -p 8080 an_image  </code>  </pre>    or publish all ports using    <pre>  <code> $ docker run -d -P an_image  </code>  </pre>    What is the point of exposing a port in the Dockerfile, if it will be published anyway? Would there ever be a need to expose a port first, and  <em> not </em>  publish it later? Effectively, I would like to specify all the ports that I will use in the Dockerfile when creating the image, and then not bother with them again, running them simply with:    <pre>  <code> $ docker run -d an_image  </code>  </pre>    Is this possible?  
 After I upgraded to the latest stable  <code> node </code>  and  <code> npm </code> , I tried  <code> npm install moment --save </code> . It saves the entry in the  <code> package.json </code>  with the caret  <code> ^ </code>  prefix. Previously, it was a tilde  <code> ~ </code>  prefix.   <ol>  Why are these changes made in  <code> npm </code> ?  What is the difference between tilde  <code> ~ </code>  and caret  <code> ^ </code> ?  What are the advantages over others?   </ol>  
 Is there no XOR operator for booleans in golang?    I was trying to do something like  <code> b1^b2 </code>  but it said it wasn't defined for booleans.  
 I set up a site with Node.js+passport for user authentication.     Now I need to migrate to Golang, and need to do authentication with the user passwords saved in db.     The Node.js encryption code is:    <pre>  <code>     var bcrypt = require('bcrypt');      bcrypt.genSalt(10, function(err, salt) {         if(err) return next(err);          bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, function(err, hash) {             if(err) return next(err);             user.password = hash;             next();         });     });  </code>  </pre>    How to make the same hashed string as Node.js bcrypt with Golang?  
 Why does Rust have  <code> String </code>  and  <code> str </code> ? What are the differences between  <code> String </code>  and  <code> str </code> ? When does one use  <code> String </code>  instead of  <code> str </code>  and vice versa? Is one of them getting deprecated?  
 I have a Nginx running inside a docker container. I have a MySql running on the host system. I want to connect to the MySql from within my container. MySql is only binding to the localhost device.   Is there any way to connect to this MySql or any other program on localhost from within this docker container?   This question is different from "How to get the IP address of the docker host from inside a docker container" due to the fact that the IP address of the docker host could be the public IP or the private IP in the network which may or may not be reachable from within the docker container (I mean public IP if hosted at AWS or something). Even if you have the IP address of the docker host it does not mean you can connect to docker host from within the container given that IP address as your Docker network may be overlay, host, bridge, macvlan, none etc which restricts the reachability of that IP address.  
 I tried working with Apiary and made a universal template to send JSON to mock server and have this code:    <pre>  <code> package main  import (     'encoding/json'     'fmt'     'github.com/jmcvetta/napping'     'log'     'net/http' )  func main() {     url := 'http://restapi3.apiary.io/notes'     fmt.Println('URL:>', url)      s := napping.Session{}     h := &amp;http.Header{}     h.Set('X-Custom-Header', 'myvalue')     s.Header = h      var jsonStr = []byte(` {     'title': 'Buy cheese and bread for breakfast.' }`)      var data map[string]json.RawMessage     err := json.Unmarshal(jsonStr, &amp;data)     if err != nil {         fmt.Println(err)     }      resp, err := s.Post(url, &amp;data, nil, nil)     if err != nil {         log.Fatal(err)     }     fmt.Println('response Status:', resp.Status())     fmt.Println('response Headers:', resp.HttpResponse().Header)     fmt.Println('response Body:', resp.RawText())  }  </code>  </pre>    This code doesn't send JSON properly, but I don't know why. The JSON string can be different in every call. I can't use  <code> Struct </code>  for this.  
 How can I print (to the console) the  <code> Id </code> ,  <code> Title </code> ,  <code> Name </code> , etc. of this struct in Golang?   <pre>  <code> type Project struct {     Id      int64   `json:"project_id"`     Title   string  `json:"title"`     Name    string  `json:"name"`     Data    Data    `json:"data"`     Commits Commits `json:"commits"` }  </code>  </pre>  
 I wrote a golang program, that uses 1.2GB of memory at runtime.    Calling  <code> go tool pprof http://10.10.58.118:8601/debug/pprof/heap </code>  results in a dump with only 323.4MB heap usage.     <ul>  What's about the rest of the memory usage?  Is there any better tool to explain golang runtime memory?   </ul>    <hr>    Using  <code> gcvis </code>  I get this:      <img src='https://i.stack.imgur.com/xiSQu.png' alt='enter image description here'>     .. and this heap form profile:     <img src='https://i.stack.imgur.com/H45IP.jpg' alt='enter image description here'>     Here is my code:  <a href='https://github.com/sharewind/push-server/blob/v3/broker' rel='noreferrer'> https://github.com/sharewind/push-server/blob/v3/broker </a>   
 I wanted to implement the  <code> Shl </code>  trait for  <code> Vec </code> , the code is below. This would make things like  <code> vec << 4 </code>  possible, which would be nice sugar for  <code> vec.push(4) </code> .    <pre>  <code> use std::ops::Shl;  impl<T> Shl<T> for Vec<T> {     type Output = Vec<T>;      fn shl(&amp;self, elem: &amp;T) -> Vec<T> {         self.push(*elem);         *self     } }  fn main() {     let v = vec![1, 2, 3];     v << 4; }  </code>  </pre>    The compilation fails with the following error:    <blockquote>     cannot provide an extension implementation where both trait and type are not defined in this crate [E0117]   </blockquote>    or    <blockquote>     type parameter  <code> T </code>  must be used as the type parameter for some local type (e.g.  <code> MyStruct<T> </code> ); only traits defined in the current crate can be implemented for a type parameter [E0210]   </blockquote>    As I understand it, I'd have to patch the stdlib, more specifically the  <code> collections::vec </code>  crate. Is there another way to change this code to compile successfully?

 What is the best way to create and use a struct with only one instantiation in the system? Yes, this is necessary, it is the OpenGL subsystem, and making multiple copies of this and passing it around everywhere would add confusion, rather than relieve it.   The singleton needs to be as efficient as possible. It doesn't seem possible to store an arbitrary object on the static area, as it contains a  <code> Vec </code>  with a destructor. The second option is to store an (unsafe) pointer on the static area, pointing to a heap allocated singleton. What is the most convenient and safest way to do this, while keeping syntax terse?  
 I'm running Jenkins inside a Docker container. I wonder if it's ok for the Jenkins container to also be a Docker host? What I'm thinking about is to start a new docker container for each integration test build from inside Jenkins (to start databases, message brokers etc). The containers should thus be shutdown after the integration tests are completed. Is there a reason to avoid running docker containers from inside another docker container in this way?  
 I'm now trying to assign a static IP 172.17.0.1 when a Docker container be started up.     I use port 2122 as the ssh port of this container so that I let this container listen port 2122.    <pre>  <code> sudo docker run -i -t -p 2122:2122 ubuntu  </code>  </pre>    This command will run a Docker container with a random IP like 172.17.0.5, but I need to assign a specific IP to the container.    The following shell script is what I reference Docker documentation in advanced network settings.    <pre>  <code> pid=$(sudo docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' <container_name> 2>/dev/null) sudo rm -rf /var/run/netns/* sudo ln -s /proc/$pid/ns/net /var/run/netns/$pid sudo ip link add A type veth peer name B sudo brctl addif docker0 A sudo ip link set A up sudo ip link set B netns $pid sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 down sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link delete eth0 sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set dev B name eth0 sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 address 12:34:56:78:9a:bc sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 down sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 up sudo ip netns exec $pid ip addr add 172.17.0.1/16 dev eth0 sudo ip netns exec $pid ip route add default via 172.17.42.1  </code>  </pre>    This shell script will assign a static IP 172.17.0.1 and link to the world fine. But whenever I try to ssh to this container from my local, it didn't work. What's the problem possibly I met?

 I'm learning/experimenting with Rust, and in all the elegance that I find in this language, there is one peculiarity that baffles me and seems totally out of place.    Rust automatically dereferences pointers when making method calls. I made some tests to determine the exact behaviour:    <pre class='lang-rust prettyprint-override'>  <code> struct X { val: i32 } impl std::ops::Deref for X {     type Target = i32;     fn deref(&amp;self) -> &amp;i32 { &amp;self.val } }  trait M { fn m(self); } impl M for i32   { fn m(self) { println!('i32::m()');  } } impl M for X     { fn m(self) { println!('X::m()');    } } impl M for &amp;X    { fn m(self) { println!('&amp;X::m()');   } } impl M for &amp;&amp;X   { fn m(self) { println!('&amp;&amp;X::m()');  } } impl M for &amp;&amp;&amp;X  { fn m(self) { println!('&amp;&amp;&amp;X::m()'); } }  trait RefM { fn refm(&amp;self); } impl RefM for i32  { fn refm(&amp;self) { println!('i32::refm()');  } } impl RefM for X    { fn refm(&amp;self) { println!('X::refm()');    } } impl RefM for &amp;X   { fn refm(&amp;self) { println!('&amp;X::refm()');   } } impl RefM for &amp;&amp;X  { fn refm(&amp;self) { println!('&amp;&amp;X::refm()');  } } impl RefM for &amp;&amp;&amp;X { fn refm(&amp;self) { println!('&amp;&amp;&amp;X::refm()'); } }   struct Y { val: i32 } impl std::ops::Deref for Y {     type Target = i32;     fn deref(&amp;self) -> &amp;i32 { &amp;self.val } }  struct Z { val: Y } impl std::ops::Deref for Z {     type Target = Y;     fn deref(&amp;self) -> &amp;Y { &amp;self.val } }   #[derive(Clone, Copy)] struct A;  impl M for    A { fn m(self) { println!('A::m()');    } } impl M for &amp;&amp;&amp;A { fn m(self) { println!('&amp;&amp;&amp;A::m()'); } }  impl RefM for    A { fn refm(&amp;self) { println!('A::refm()');    } } impl RefM for &amp;&amp;&amp;A { fn refm(&amp;self) { println!('&amp;&amp;&amp;A::refm()'); } }   fn main() {     // I'll use @ to denote left side of the dot operator     (*X{val:42}).m();        // i32::m()    , Self == @     X{val:42}.m();           // X::m()      , Self == @     (&amp;X{val:42}).m();        // &amp;X::m()     , Self == @     (&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).m();       // &amp;&amp;X::m()    , Self == @     (&amp;&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).m();      // &amp;&amp;&amp;X:m()    , Self == @     (&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).m();     // &amp;&amp;&amp;X::m()   , Self == *@     (&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).m();    // &amp;&amp;&amp;X::m()   , Self == **@     println!('-------------------------');      (*X{val:42}).refm();     // i32::refm() , Self == @     X{val:42}.refm();        // X::refm()   , Self == @     (&amp;X{val:42}).refm();     // X::refm()   , Self == *@     (&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).refm();    // &amp;X::refm()  , Self == *@     (&amp;&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).refm();   // &amp;&amp;X::refm() , Self == *@     (&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).refm();  // &amp;&amp;&amp;X::refm(), Self == *@     (&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;X{val:42}).refm(); // &amp;&amp;&amp;X::refm(), Self == **@     println!('-------------------------');      Y{val:42}.refm();        // i32::refm() , Self == *@     Z{val:Y{val:42}}.refm(); // i32::refm() , Self == **@     println!('-------------------------');      A.m();                   // A::m()      , Self == @     // without the Copy trait, (&amp;A).m() would be a compilation error:     // cannot move out of borrowed content     (&amp;A).m();                // A::m()      , Self == *@     (&amp;&amp;A).m();               // &amp;&amp;&amp;A::m()   , Self == &amp;@     (&amp;&amp;&amp;A).m();              // &amp;&amp;&amp;A::m()   , Self == @     A.refm();                // A::refm()   , Self == @     (&amp;A).refm();             // A::refm()   , Self == *@     (&amp;&amp;A).refm();            // A::refm()   , Self == **@     (&amp;&amp;&amp;A).refm();           // &amp;&amp;&amp;A::refm(), Self == @ }  </code>  </pre>    ( <a href='https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&amp;mode=debug&amp;edition=2018&amp;gist=d7a379b91c949c676c399b22fd97ddad' rel='noreferrer'> Playground </a> )    So, it seems that, more or less:    <ul>  The compiler will insert as many dereference operators as necessary to invoke a method.  The compiler, when resolving methods declared using  <code> &amp;self </code>  (call-by-reference):   <ul>  First tries calling for a single dereference of  <code> self </code>   Then tries calling for the exact type of  <code> self </code>   Then, tries inserting as many dereference operators as necessary for a match   </ul>   Methods declared using  <code> self </code>  (call-by-value) for type  <code> T </code>  behave as if they were declared using  <code> &amp;self </code>  (call-by-reference) for type  <code> &amp;T </code>  and called on the reference to whatever is on the left side of the dot operator.  The above rules are first tried with raw built-in dereferencing, and if there's no match, the overload with  <code> Deref </code>  trait is used.   </ul>    What are the exact auto-dereferencing rules? Can anyone give any formal rationale for such a design decision?  
 Supposed I have a Docker container and a folder on my host  <code> /hostFolder </code> . Now if I want to add this folder to the Docker container as a volume, then I can do this either by using  <code> ADD </code>  in the  <code> Dockerfile </code>  or mounting it as a volume.    So far, so good.    Now  <code> /hostFolder </code>  contains a sub-folder,  <code> /hostFolder/subFolder </code> .    I want to mount  <code> /hostFolder </code>  into the Docker container (whether as read-write or read-only does not matter, works both for me), but I do  <strong> NOT </strong>  want to have it included  <code> /hostFolder/subFolder </code> . I want to exclude this, and I also want the Docker container be able to make changes to this sub-folder, without the consequence of having it changed on the host as well.    Is this possible? If so, how?  
 There are several questions that seem to be about the same problem I'm having. For example see  <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24542064/why-does-the-variable-not-live-long-enough'> here </a>  and  <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26435791/as-slice-produces-not-live-enough-error'> here </a> . Basically I'm trying to build a  <code> String </code>  in a local function, but then return it as a  <code> &amp;str </code> . Slicing isn't working because the lifetime is too short. I can't use  <code> str </code>  directly in the function because I need to build it dynamically. However, I'd also prefer not to return a  <code> String </code>  since the nature of the object this is going into is static once it's built. Is there a way to have my cake and eat it too?    Here's a minimal non-compiling reproduction:    <pre>  <code> fn return_str<'a>() -> &amp;'a str {     let mut string = ''.to_string();      for i in 0..10 {         string.push_str('ACTG');     }      &amp;string[..] }  </code>  </pre>  
 I have a Python (2.7) app which is started in my dockerfile:    <pre>  <code> CMD ['python','main.py']  </code>  </pre>     <em> main.py </em>  prints some strings when it is started and goes into a loop afterwards:    <pre>  <code> print 'App started' while True:     time.sleep(1)  </code>  </pre>    As long as I start the container with the -it flag, everything works as expected:    <pre>  <code> $ docker run --name=myapp -it myappimage > App started  </code>  </pre>    And I can see the same output via logs later:    <pre>  <code> $ docker logs myapp > App started  </code>  </pre>    If I try to run the same container with the -d flag, the container seems to start normally, but I can't see any output:    <pre>  <code> $ docker run --name=myapp -d myappimage > b82db1120fee5f92c80000f30f6bdc84e068bafa32738ab7adb47e641b19b4d1 $ docker logs myapp $ (empty)  </code>  </pre>    But the container still seems to run;    <pre>  <code> $ docker ps Container Status ... myapp     up 4 minutes ...   </code>  </pre>    Attach does not display anything either:    <pre>  <code> $ docker attach --sig-proxy=false myapp (working, no output)  </code>  </pre>    Any ideas whats going wrong?

So I tried ' <strong>  <code> docker ps -a </code>  </strong> ', I can see container already exited:    <pre>  <code> root@docker:/home/root# docker ps -a CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                 COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                         PORTS               NAMES 605e3928cddd        centos:latest         '/bin/bash'         31 minutes ago      Exited (0) 31 minutes ago                          kickass_swartz  </code>  </pre>    Anything I did wrong? How can I troubleshoot this issue?  
 I have an app whose only dependency is flask, which runs fine outside docker and binds to the default port  <code> 5000 </code> . Here is the full source:   <pre class='lang-py prettyprint-override'>  <code> from flask import Flask  app = Flask(__name__) app.debug = True  @app.route('/') def main():     return 'hi'  if __name__ == '__main__':     app.run()  </code>  </pre>   The problem is that when I deploy this in docker, the server is running but is unreachable from outside the container.   Below is my  <code> Dockerfile </code> . The image is ubuntu with flask installed. The tar just contains the  <code> index.py </code>  listed above;   <pre>  <code> # Dockerfile FROM dreen/flask MAINTAINER dreen WORKDIR /srv  # Get source RUN mkdir -p /srv COPY perfektimprezy.tar.gz /srv/perfektimprezy.tar.gz RUN tar x -f perfektimprezy.tar.gz RUN rm perfektimprezy.tar.gz  # Run server EXPOSE 5000 CMD ["python", "index.py"]  </code>  </pre>   Here are the steps I am doing to deploy    <code> $> sudo docker build -t perfektimprezy . </code>    As far as I know the above runs fine, the image has the contents of the tar in  <code> /srv </code> . Now, let's start the server in a container:   <pre>  <code> $> sudo docker run -i -p 5000:5000 -d perfektimprezy 1c50b67d45b1a4feade72276394811c8399b1b95692e0914ee72b103ff54c769  </code>  </pre>   Is it actually running?   <pre>  <code> $> sudo docker ps CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                   COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                    NAMES 1c50b67d45b1        perfektimprezy:latest   "python index.py"   5 seconds ago       Up 5 seconds        0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   loving_wozniak  </code>  </pre>   <pre>  <code> $> sudo docker logs 1c50b67d45b1     * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)     * Restarting with stat  </code>  </pre>   Yep, seems like the flask server is running.

 Can anyone tell me, how to use  <strong> jQuery </strong>  with  <strong> Angular </strong> ?    <pre>  <code> class MyComponent {     constructor() {         // how to query the DOM element from here?     } }  </code>  </pre>    I'm aware there are workarounds like manipulating the  <em> class </em>  or  <em> id </em>  of the DOM element upfront, but I'm hoping for a cleaner way of doing it.  
 I am using Angular 2.0.0-alpha.30 version. When redirect to a different route, then refresh the browser , its showing Cannot GET /route.    Can you help me with figuring why this error happened.  
 I am writing an Angular application and I have an HTML response I want to display.     How do I do that? If I simply use the binding syntax  <code> {{myVal}} </code>  it encodes all HTML characters (of course).    I need somehow to bind the  <code> innerHTML </code>  of a  <code> div </code>  to the variable value.  
 I have 2 Lambda functions - one that produces a quote and one that turns a quote into an order. I'd like the Order lambda function to call the Quote function to regenerate the quote, rather than just receive it from an untrusted client.    I've looked everywhere I can think of - but can't see how I'd go about chaining or calling the functions...surely this exists!  
 I am using rabbitmq and a simple python sample from  <a href='https://www.rabbitmq.com/tutorials/tutorial-one-python.html' rel='noreferrer'> here </a>  together with docker-compose. My problem is that I need to wait for rabbitmq to be fully started. From what I searched so far, I don't know how to wait with container x (in my case worker) until y (rabbitmq) is started.   I found this  <a href='http://blog.chmouel.com/2014/11/04/avoiding-race-conditions-between-containers-with-docker-and-fig/' rel='noreferrer'> blog post </a>  where he checks if the other host is online.

My solution so far is to wait some seconds and check the port, but is this the way to achieve this? If I don't wait, I get an error.    <strong> docker-compose.yml </strong>    <pre class='lang-yaml prettyprint-override'>  <code> worker:     build: myapp/.     volumes:     - myapp/.:/usr/src/app:ro      links:     - rabbitmq rabbitmq:     image: rabbitmq:3-management  </code>  </pre>    <strong> python hello sample (rabbit.py): </strong>    <pre class='lang-py prettyprint-override'>  <code> import pika import time  import socket  pingcounter = 0 isreachable = False while isreachable is False and pingcounter < 5:     s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)     try:         s.connect(('rabbitmq', 5672))         isreachable = True     except socket.error as e:         time.sleep(2)         pingcounter += 1     s.close()  if isreachable:     connection = pika.BlockingConnection(pika.ConnectionParameters(             host="rabbitmq"))     channel = connection.channel()      channel.queue_declare(queue='hello')      channel.basic_publish(exchange='',                           routing_key='hello',                           body='Hello World!')     print (" [x] Sent 'Hello World!'")     connection.close()  </code>  </pre>    <strong> Dockerfile for worker: </strong>    <pre>  <code> FROM python:2-onbuild RUN ["pip", "install", "pika"]  CMD ["python","rabbit.py"]  </code>  </pre>    <strong> Update Nov 2015 </strong> :   A shell script or waiting inside your program is maybe a possible solution. But after seeing this  <a href='https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/374' rel='noreferrer'> Issue </a>  I am looking for a command or feature of docker/docker-compose itself.   They mention a  solution for implementing a health check, which may be the best option. A open tcp connection does not mean your service is ready or may remain ready.

So I am hoping for an answer with docker-compose on board commands, which will hopefully the case if they finish this issue.    <strong> Update March 2016 </strong>    There is a  <a href='https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/21142' rel='noreferrer'> proposal </a>  for providing a built-in way to determine if a container is "alive".

 I have a value and I want to store that value and a reference to something inside that value in my own type:    <pre>  <code> struct Thing {     count: u32, }  struct Combined<'a>(Thing, &amp;'a u32);  fn make_combined<'a>() -> Combined<'a> {     let thing = Thing { count: 42 };      Combined(thing, &amp;thing.count) }  </code>  </pre>    Sometimes, I have a value and I want to store that value and a reference to that value in the same structure:    <pre>  <code> struct Combined<'a>(Thing, &amp;'a Thing);  fn make_combined<'a>() -> Combined<'a> {     let thing = Thing::new();      Combined(thing, &amp;thing) }  </code>  </pre>    Sometimes, I'm not even taking a reference of the value and I get the same error:    <pre>  <code> struct Combined<'a>(Parent, Child<'a>);  fn make_combined<'a>() -> Combined<'a> {     let parent = Parent::new();     let child = parent.child();      Combined(parent, child) }  </code>  </pre>    In each of these cases, I get an error that one of the values 'does not live long enough'. What does this error mean?  
 I want to write a program that will write a file in 2 steps. It is likely that the file may not exist before the program is run. The filename is fixed.    The problem is that  <code> OpenOptions.new().write() </code>  can fail. In that case, I want to call a custom function  <code> trycreate() </code> . The idea is to create the file instead of opening it and return a handle. Since the filename is fixed,  <code> trycreate() </code>  has no arguments and I cannot set a lifetime of the returned value.    How can I resolve this problem?    <pre>  <code> use std::io::Write; use std::fs::OpenOptions; use std::path::Path;  fn trycreate() -> &amp;OpenOptions {     let f = OpenOptions::new().write(true).open('foo.txt');     let mut f = match f {         Ok(file)  => file,         Err(_)  => panic!('ERR'),     };     f }  fn main() {     {         let f = OpenOptions::new().write(true).open(b'foo.txt');         let mut f = match f {             Ok(file)  => file,             Err(_)  => trycreate('foo.txt'),         };         let buf = b'test1\n';         let _ret = f.write(buf).unwrap();     }     println!('50%');     {         let f = OpenOptions::new().append(true).open('foo.txt');         let mut f = match f {             Ok(file)  => file,             Err(_)  => panic!('append'),         };         let buf = b'test2\n';         let _ret = f.write(buf).unwrap();     }     println!('Ok'); }  </code>  </pre>  
 Does anybody know how to get hold of an element defined in a component template? Polymer makes it really easy with the  <code> $ </code>  and  <code> $$ </code> .    I was just wondering how to go about it in Angular.    Take the example from the tutorial:    <pre>  <code> import {Component} from '@angular/core';  @Component({     selector:'display',     template:`      <input #myname (input)='updateName(myname.value)'/>      <p>My name : {{myName}}</p>      `    }) export class DisplayComponent {     myName: string = 'Aman';     updateName(input: String) {         this.myName = input;     } }  </code>  </pre>    How do I catch hold or get a reference of the  <code> p </code>  or  <code> input </code>  element from within the class definition?  
 I'm writing a WebSocket server where a web client connects to play chess against a multithreaded computer AI. The WebSocket server wants to pass a  <code> Logger </code>  object into the AI code. The  <code> Logger </code>  object is going to pipe down log lines from the AI to the web client. The  <code> Logger </code>  must contain a reference to the client connection.   I'm confused about how lifetimes interact with threads. I've reproduced the problem with a  <code> Wrapper </code>  struct parameterized by a type. The  <code> run_thread </code>  function tries to unwrap the value and log it.   <pre class='lang-rs prettyprint-override'>  <code> use std::fmt::Debug; use std::thread;  struct Wrapper<T: Debug> {     val: T, }  fn run_thread<T: Debug>(wrapper: Wrapper<T>) {     let thr = thread::spawn(move || {         println!("{:?}", wrapper.val);     });      thr.join(); }  fn main() {     run_thread(Wrapper::<i32> { val: -1 }); }  </code>  </pre>   The  <code> wrapper </code>  argument lives on the stack, and its lifetime doesn't extend past  <code> run_thread </code> 's stack frame, even though the thread will be joined before the stack frame ends. I'd could copy the value off the stack:   <pre class='lang-rs prettyprint-override'>  <code> use std::fmt::Debug; use std::thread;  struct Wrapper<T: Debug + Send> {     val: T, }  fn run_thread<T: Debug + Send + 'static>(wrapper: Wrapper<T>) {     let thr = thread::spawn(move || {         println!("{:?}", wrapper.val);     });      thr.join(); }  fn main() {     run_thread(Wrapper::<i32> { val: -1 }); }  </code>  </pre>   This will not work if  <code> T </code>  is a reference to a big object I don't want copied:   <pre class='lang-rs prettyprint-override'>  <code> use std::fmt::Debug; use std::thread;  struct Wrapper<T: Debug + Send> {     val: T, }  fn run_thread<T: Debug + Send + 'static>(wrapper: Wrapper<T>) {     let thr = thread::spawn(move || {         println!("{:?}", wrapper.val);     });      thr.join(); }  fn main() {     let mut v = Vec::new();     for i in 0..1000 {         v.push(i);     }      run_thread(Wrapper { val: &amp;v }); }  </code>  </pre>   Which results in:   <pre class='lang-none prettyprint-override'>  <code> error: `v` does not live long enough   --> src/main.rs:22:32    | 22 |     run_thread(Wrapper { val: &amp;v });    |                                ^ does not live long enough 23 | }    | - borrowed value only lives until here    |    = note: borrowed value must be valid for the static lifetime...  </code>  </pre>   The only solution I can think of is to use an  <code> Arc </code> .   <pre>  <code> use std::fmt::Debug; use std::sync::Arc; use std::thread;  struct Wrapper<T: Debug + Send + Sync + 'static> {     arc_val: Arc<T>, }  fn run_thread<T: Debug + Send + Sync + 'static>(wrapper: &amp;Wrapper<T>) {     let arc_val = wrapper.arc_val.clone();     let thr = thread::spawn(move || {         println!("{:?}", *arc_val);     });      thr.join(); }  fn main() {     let mut v = Vec::new();     for i in 0..1000 {         v.push(i);     }      let w = Wrapper { arc_val: Arc::new(v) };     run_thread(&amp;w);      println!("{}", (*w.arc_val)[0]); }  </code>  </pre>   In my real program, it appears that both the  <code> Logger </code>  and the connection object must be placed in  <code> Arc </code>  wrappers. It seems annoying that the client is required to box the connection in an  <code> Arc </code>  when it is internal to the library that the code is parallelized. This is especially annoying because the lifetime of the connection is guaranteed to be greater than the lifetime of the worker threads.   Have I missed something?  
 Python can multiply strings like so:    <pre>  <code> Python 3.4.3 (default, Mar 26 2015, 22:03:40) [GCC 4.9.2] on linux Type 'help', 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information. >>> x = 'my new text is this long' >>> y = '#' * len(x) >>> y '########################' >>>  </code>  </pre>    Can Golang do the equivalent somehow?  
 I'm trying to solve 'The go programming lanaguage' exercise #1.4 which requires me to have a set. I can create a set type but why doesn't the language come with one ? go, having come from google, where guava also originated, why didn't the language designers opt for adding support for fundamental data structures ? why force your users to create their own implementations for something so basic as a set ?  
 Apparently, Angular 2 will use pipes instead of filters as in Angular1 in conjunction with ng-for to filter results, although the implementation still seems to be vague, with no clear documentation.    Namely what I'm trying to achieve could be viewed from the following perspective    <pre>  <code> <div *ng-for='#item of itemsList' *ng-if='conditon(item)'></div>  </code>  </pre>    How to implement so using pipes?  
 I created a virtual machine in Azure and then deleted it. However, the associated storage account still exists. I can't delete the storage account because it contains a container with a blob in it that has an indefinite lease. <br>  Nothing else is using this storage account. <br>  How can I delete this blob?  
 I am trying to implement something like a delegation pattern in Angular.  When the user clicks on a  <code> nav-item </code> , I would like to call a function which then emits an event which should in turn be handled by some other component listening for the event.    Here is the scenario: I have a  <code> Navigation </code>  component:      <pre class='lang-ts prettyprint-override'>  <code> import {Component, Output, EventEmitter} from 'angular2/core';  @Component({     // other properties left out for brevity     events : ['navchange'],      template:`       <div class='nav-item' (click)='selectedNavItem(1)'></div>     ` })  export class Navigation {      @Output() navchange: EventEmitter<number> = new EventEmitter();      selectedNavItem(item: number) {         console.log('selected nav item ' + item);         this.navchange.emit(item)     }  }  </code>  </pre>    Here is the observing component:     <pre class='lang-ts prettyprint-override'>  <code> export class ObservingComponent {    // How do I observe the event ?    // <----------Observe/Register Event ?-------->    public selectedNavItem(item: number) {     console.log('item index changed!');   }  }  </code>  </pre>    The key question is, how do I make the observing component observe the event in question ?   
 I'm having a problem with trying to use Angular's  <code> *ngFor </code>  and  <code> *ngIf </code>  on the same element.     When trying to loop through the collection in the  <code> *ngFor </code> , the collection is seen as  <code> null </code>  and consequently fails when trying to access its properties in the template.    <pre class='lang-ts prettyprint-override'>  <code> @Component({   selector: 'shell',   template: `     <h3>Shell</h3><button (click)='toggle()'>Toggle!</button>      <div *ngIf='show' *ngFor='let thing of stuff'>       {{log(thing)}}       <span>{{thing.name}}</span>     </div>   ` })  export class ShellComponent implements OnInit {    public stuff:any[] = [];   public show:boolean = false;    constructor() {}    ngOnInit() {     this.stuff = [       { name: 'abc', id: 1 },       { name: 'huo', id: 2 },       { name: 'bar', id: 3 },       { name: 'foo', id: 4 },       { name: 'thing', id: 5 },       { name: 'other', id: 6 },     ]   }    toggle() {     this.show = !this.show;   }    log(thing) {     console.log(thing);   }  }  </code>  </pre>    I know the easy solution is to move the  <code> *ngIf </code>  up a level but for scenarios like looping over list items in a  <code> ul </code> , I'd end up with either an empty  <code> li </code>  if the collection is empty, or my  <code> li </code> s wrapped in redundant container elements.    Example at this  <a href='http://plnkr.co/edit/C5tZ8mD3iWczVvWkWycH?p=preview' rel='noreferrer'> plnkr </a> .    Note the console error:    <pre>  <code> EXCEPTION: TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null in [{{thing.name}} in ShellComponent@5:12]  </code>  </pre>    Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?  
 I want to manually compile some HTML containing directives.  What is the equivalent of  <code> $compile </code>  in Angular 2?    For example, in Angular 1, I could dynamically compile a fragment of HTML and append it to the DOM:     <pre>  <code> var e = angular.element('<div directive></div>'); element.append(e); $compile(e)($scope);  </code>  </pre>  
 I'm writing an Angular component that has a property  <code> Mode(): string </code> .    I would like to be able to set this property programmatically not in response to any event.    The problem is that in the absence of a browser event, a template binding  <code> {{Mode}} </code>  doesn't update.    Is there a way to trigger this change detection manually?  
 Do you need to unsubscribe from Angular 2 http calls to prevent memory leak?    <pre>  <code>  fetchFilm(index) {         var sub = this._http.get(`http://example.com`)             .map(result => result.json())             .map(json => {                 dispatch(this.receiveFilm(json));             })             .subscribe(e=>sub.unsubscribe());             ...  </code>  </pre>  
 I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:    <ul>   <code> npm </code>  &amp;  <code> bower </code>  are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call  <code> webpack </code> / <code> gulp </code> / <code> grunt </code>  after fetching all the dependencies.   <code> bower </code>  is like  <code> npm </code> , but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike  <code> npm </code>  which does it recursively). Meaning  <code> npm </code>  fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while  <code> bower </code>  expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes  <code> bower </code>  and  <code> npm </code>  are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).   <code> grunt </code>  and  <code> gulp </code>  are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).   <code> grunt </code>  vs.  <code> gulp </code>  (is like  <code> maven </code>  vs.  <code> gradle </code>  or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster.    <code> webpack </code>  ( <code> webpack-dev-server </code> ) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers.    <code> npm </code> / <code> bower </code>  + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use  <code> gulp </code> / <code> grunt </code>  over  <code> npm </code>  + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. 'on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp').   <code> browserify </code>  allows packaging node modules for browsers.  <code> browserify </code>  vs  <code> node </code> 's  <code> require </code>  is actually  <a href='https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/' rel='noreferrer'> AMD vs CommonJS </a> .   </ul>     <strong>  <em> Questions: </em>  </strong>     <ol>   <em> What is  <code> webpack </code>  &amp;  <code> webpack-dev-server </code> ? </em>  Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner.  <em> What's the difference? </em>    <em> Where would you use  <code> browserify </code> ? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports? </em>     <em> When would you use  <code> gulp </code> / <code> grunt </code>  over  <code> npm </code>  + plugins? </em>    <em> Please provide examples when you need to use a combination </em>    </ol>  
 What is wrong with my Angular code? I am getting the following error:   <blockquote>   Cannot read property 'remove' of undefined at BrowserDomAdapter.removeClass   </blockquote>   <pre class='lang-html prettyprint-override'>  <code> <ol>   <li *ngClass="{active: step==='step1'}" (click)="step='step1'">Step1</li>   <li *ngClass="{active: step==='step2'}" (click)="step='step2'">Step2</li>   <li *ngClass="{active: step==='step3'}" (click)="step='step3'">Step3</li> </ol>  </code>  </pre>

 I am experimenting with AWS S3 and CloudFront for a web application that I am developing.     In the app I'm letting users upload files to the S3 bucket (using the AWS SDK) and make it available via CloudFront CDN, but the issue is even when the files are uploaded and ready in the S3 bucket it takes about a minute or 2 to be available in the CloudFront CDN url, is this normal?  
 I am a bit confused about how to get the  <code> key </code>  and  <code> value </code>  of an object in angular2 while using  <code> *ngFor </code>  for iterating over the object. I know in angular 1.x there is a syntax like     <pre class='lang-html prettyprint-override'>  <code> ng-repeat='(key, value) in demo'  </code>  </pre>    but I don't know how to do the same in angular2. I have tried something similar, without success:    <pre class='lang-html prettyprint-override'>  <code>     <ul>       <li *ngFor='#key of demo'>{{key}}</li>     </ul>      demo = {         'key1': [{'key11':'value11'}, {'key12':'value12'}],         'key2': [{'key21':'value21'}, {'key22':'value22'}],       }  </code>  </pre>    Here is a plnkr with my attempt:  <a href='http://plnkr.co/edit/mIj619FncOpfdwrR0KeG?p=preview' rel='noreferrer'> http://plnkr.co/edit/mIj619FncOpfdwrR0KeG?p=preview </a>     How can I get  <code> key1 </code>  and  <code> key2 </code>  dynamically using  <code> *ngFor </code> ? After searching extensively, I found the idea of using pipes but I don't know how to go about it. Is there any inbuilt pipe for doing the same in angular2?  
 Angular provides life cycle hook  <code> ngOnInit </code>  by default.    Why should  <code> ngOnInit </code>  be used, if we already have a  <code> constructor </code> ?  
 There are many cases using  <strong> nil </strong>  in golang. For example:    <pre>  <code> func (u *URL) Parse(ref string) (*URL, error) {     refurl, err := Parse(ref)     if err != nil {         return nil, err     }     return u.ResolveReference(refurl), nil }  </code>  </pre>    but we can't use it like this:    <pre>  <code> var str string //or var str int str = nil  </code>  </pre>    the golang compiler will throw a  <code> can't use nil as type string in assignment </code>  error.    Looks like  <code> nil </code>  can only be used for a pointer of struct and interface. If that is the case, then  <strong> what does it mean? </strong>  and  <strong> when we use it to compare to the other object, how do they compare, in other words, how does golang determine one object is nil </strong> ?     <strong> EDIT:For example, if an interface is nil, its type and value must be nil at the same time. How does golang do this? </strong>   
 I've read questions like  <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36059564/access-eventemitter-service-inside-of-customhttp'> Access EventEmitter Service inside of CustomHttp </a>  where the user uses EventEmitter in his service, but he was suggested in this  <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36059564/access-eventemitter-service-inside-of-customhttp#comment59766410_36059564'> comment </a>  not to use it and to use instead Observables directly in his services.   I also read this  <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36014395/angular-2-two-way-communication-between-components/36014451#36014451'> question </a>  where the solution suggests to pass the EventEmitter to the child and subscribe to it.   My question then is: Should I, or should I not subscribe manually to an EventEmitter? How should I use it?  
 By using Http, we call a method that does a network call and returns an http observable:      <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'>  <code> getCustomer() {     return this.http.get('/someUrl').map(res => res.json()); }  </code>  </pre>    If we take this observable and add multiple subscribers to it:    <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'>  <code> let network$ = getCustomer();  let subscriber1 = network$.subscribe(...); let subscriber2 = network$.subscribe(...);  </code>  </pre>    What we want to do, is ensure that this does not cause multiple network requests.    This might seem like an unusual scenario, but its actually quite common: for example if the caller subscribes to the observable to display an error message, and passes it to the template using the async pipe, we already have two subscribers.    What is the correct way of doing that in RxJs 5?     Namely, this seems to work fine:    <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'>  <code> getCustomer() {     return this.http.get('/someUrl').map(res => res.json()).share(); }  </code>  </pre>    But is this the idiomatic way of doing this in RxJs 5, or should we do something else instead?      <em> Note : As per Angular 5 new  <code> HttpClient </code> , the  <code> .map(res => res.json()) </code>  part in all examples is now useless, as JSON result is now assumed by default. </em>   
 Is it possible to convert a  <code> string </code>  to an  <code> io.Writer </code>  type in Golang?    I will be using this string in  <code> fmt.Fprintf() </code>  but I am unable to convert the type.  
 I'm trying to setup a tab system that allows for components to register themselves (with a title). The first tab is like an inbox, there's plenty of actions/link items to choose from for the users, and each of these clicks should be able to instantiate a new component, on click. The actions / links comes in from JSON.    The instantiated component will then register itself as a new tab.    I'm not sure if this is the 'best' approach? So far, the only guides I've seen are for static tabs, which doesn't help.    So far, I've only got the tabs service which is bootstrapped in main to persist throughout the app. It looks something like this:    <pre>  <code> export interface ITab { title: string; }  @Injectable() export class TabsService {     private tabs = new Set<ITab>();      addTab(title: string): ITab {         let tab: ITab = { title };         this.tabs.add(tab);         return tab;     }      removeTab(tab: ITab) {         this.tabs.delete(tab);     } }  </code>  </pre>    Questions:    <ol>  How can I have a dynamic list in the inbox that creates new (different) tabs? I am sort of guessing the  <code> DynamicComponentBuilder </code>  would be used?  How can the components be created from the inbox (on click) register themselves as tabs and also be shown? I'm guessing  <code> ng-content </code> , but I can't find much info on how to use it   </ol>     <strong> EDIT: </strong>  An attempt to clarify.    Think of the inbox as a mail inbox. Items are fetched as JSON and it displays several items. Once one of the items is clicked, a new tab is created with that items action 'type'. The type is then a component.     <strong> EDIT 2: </strong>   <a href='https://i.imgur.com/yzfMOXJ.png' rel='noreferrer'> Image </a> .

 I am learning golang(beginner) and I have been searching on both google and stackoverflow but I could not find an answer so excuse me if already asked, but how can I mkdir if not exists in golang.

 When should I store the  <code> Subscription </code>  instances and invoke  <code> unsubscribe() </code>  during the  <code> ngOnDestroy </code>  life cycle and when can I simply ignore them?   Saving all subscriptions introduces a lot of mess into component code.    <a href='https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/server-communication.html' rel='noreferrer'> HTTP Client Guide </a>  ignore subscriptions like this:   <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'>  <code> getHeroes() {   this.heroService.getHeroes()                   .subscribe(                      heroes => this.heroes = heroes,                      error =>  this.errorMessage = <any>error); }  </code>  </pre>   In the same time  <a href='https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html' rel='noreferrer'> Route &amp; Navigation Guide </a>  says that:   <blockquote>   Eventually, we'll navigate somewhere else. The router will remove this component from the DOM and destroy it. We need to clean up after ourselves before that happens. Specifically, we must unsubscribe before Angular destroys the component. Failure to do so could create a memory leak.

 I have two separate  <code> docker-compose.yml </code>  files in two different folders:    <ul>   <code> ~/front/docker-compose.yml </code>    <code> ~/api/docker-compose.yml </code>    </ul>    How can I make sure that a container in  <code> front </code>  can send requests to a container in  <code> api </code> ?    I know that  <code> --default-gateway </code>  option can be set using  <code> docker run </code>  for an individual container, so that a specific IP address can be assigned to this container, but it seems that this option is not available when using  <code> docker-compose </code> .    Currently I end up doing a  <code> docker inspect my_api_container_id </code>  and look at the gateway in the output. It works but the problem is that this IP is randomly attributed, so I can't rely on it.    Another form of this question might thus be:    <ul>  Can I attribute a fixed IP address to a particular container using docker-compose?   </ul>    But in the end what I'm looking after is:    <ul>  How can two different docker-compose projects communicate with each other?   </ul>

 I want to dynamically create a template. This should be used to build a  <code> ComponentType </code>  at runtime and place  <em> (even replace) </em>  it somewhere inside of the hosting Component.     Until RC4 I was using  <code> ComponentResolver </code> , but with RC5 I get the following message:    <pre class='lang-none prettyprint-override'>  <code> ComponentResolver is deprecated for dynamic compilation. Use ComponentFactoryResolver together with @NgModule/@Component.entryComponents or ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS provider instead. For runtime compile only, you can also use Compiler.compileComponentSync/Async.  </code>  </pre>    I found this document ( <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VRNljdv-6QDY4_I0xx3DHd-IZ19QlthheMLdGGKAAzM/edit?usp=sharing' rel='noreferrer'> Angular 2 Synchronous Dynamic Component Creation </a> )    And understand that I can use either    <ul>  Kind of dynamic  <code> ngIf </code>  with  <code> ComponentFactoryResolver </code> . If I pass known components inside of  <code> @Component({entryComponents: [comp1, comp2], ...}) </code>  - I can use  <code> .resolveComponentFactory(componentToRender); </code>   Real runtime compilation, with  <code> Compiler </code> ...    </ul>    But the question is how to use that  <code> Compiler </code> ? The note above says that I should call:  <code> Compiler.compileComponentSync/Async </code>  - so how?     For example. I want to create  <em> (based on some configuration conditions) </em>  this kind of template for one kind of settings    <pre class='lang-html prettyprint-override'>  <code> <form>    <string-editor      [propertyName]=''code''      [entity]='entity'    ></string-editor>    <string-editor      [propertyName]=''description''      [entity]='entity'    ></string-editor>    ...  </code>  </pre>    and in another case this one  <em> ( <code> string-editor </code>  is replaced with  <code> text-editor </code> ) </em>     <pre class='lang-html prettyprint-override'>  <code> <form>    <text-editor      [propertyName]=''code''      [entity]='entity'    ></text-editor>    ...  </code>  </pre>    And so on  <em> (different number/date/reference  <code> editors </code>  by property types, skipped some properties for some users...) </em> . i.e. this is an example, the real configuration could generate much more different and complex templates.    The template is changing, so I cannot use  <code> ComponentFactoryResolver </code>  and pass existing ones... I need a solution with the  <code> Compiler </code> .  
 In Golang, we use structs with receiver methods. everything is perfect up to here. <br>  I'm not sure what interfaces are, however. We define methods in structs and if we want to implement a method on a struct, we write it anyway again under another struct. <br>  This means that interfaces seem to be just method definitions, taking just extra unneeded space on our page.    Is there any example explaining why I need an interface?

 I'm looking into Angular RxJs patterns and I don't understand the difference between a  <code> BehaviorSubject </code>  and an  <code> Observable </code> .    From my understanding, a  <code> BehaviorSubject </code>  is a value that can change over time (can be subscribed to and subscribers can receive updated results). This seems to be the exact same purpose of an  <code> Observable </code> .      When would you use an  <code> Observable </code>  vs a  <code> BehaviorSubject </code> ? Are there benefits to using a  <code> BehaviorSubject </code>  over an  <code> Observable </code>  or vice versa?

 Rust has an  <a href='https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2094-nll.md' rel='noreferrer'> RFC </a>  related to non-lexical lifetimes which  <a href='https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2094' rel='noreferrer'> has been approved </a>  to be implemented in the language for a long time.  <a href='https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46862' rel='noreferrer'> Recently </a> , Rust's support of this feature has improved a lot and is considered complete.    My question is:  <strong> what exactly is a non-lexical lifetime? </strong>   
 I setup a single node Kafka Docker container on my local machine like it is described in  <a href='https://docs.confluent.io/current/installation/docker/docs/installation/recipes/single-node-client.html' rel='noreferrer'> the Confluent documentation </a>  (steps 2-3).    In addition, I also exposed Zookeeper's port 2181 and Kafka's port 9092 so that I'll be able to connect to them from a client running on local machine:    <pre>  <code> $ docker run -d \     -p 2181:2181 \     --net=confluent \     --name=zookeeper \     -e ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=2181 \     confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:4.1.0  $ docker run -d \     --net=confluent \     --name=kafka \     -p 9092:9092 \     -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181 \     -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092 \     -e KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 \     confluentinc/cp-kafka:4.1.0  </code>  </pre>     <strong> Problem: </strong>  When I try to connect to Kafka from the host machine, the connection fails because it  <code> can't resolve address: kafka:9092 </code> .    Here is my Java code:    <pre>  <code> Properties props = new Properties(); props.put('bootstrap.servers', 'localhost:9092'); props.put('client.id', 'KafkaExampleProducer'); props.put('key.serializer', LongSerializer.class.getName()); props.put('value.serializer', StringSerializer.class.getName()); KafkaProducer<Long, String> producer = new KafkaProducer<>(props); ProducerRecord<Long, String> record = new ProducerRecord<>('foo', 1L, 'Test 1'); producer.send(record).get(); producer.flush();  </code>  </pre>    The exception:    <pre>  <code> java.io.IOException: Can't resolve address: kafka:9092     at org.apache.kafka.common.network.Selector.doConnect(Selector.java:235) ~[kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     at org.apache.kafka.common.network.Selector.connect(Selector.java:214) ~[kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     at org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient.initiateConnect(NetworkClient.java:864) [kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     at org.apache.kafka.clients.NetworkClient.ready(NetworkClient.java:265) [kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.sendProducerData(Sender.java:266) [kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.run(Sender.java:238) [kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     at org.apache.kafka.clients.producer.internals.Sender.run(Sender.java:176) [kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:748) [na:1.8.0_144] Caused by: java.nio.channels.UnresolvedAddressException: null     at sun.nio.ch.Net.checkAddress(Net.java:101) ~[na:1.8.0_144]     at sun.nio.ch.SocketChannelImpl.connect(SocketChannelImpl.java:622) ~[na:1.8.0_144]     at org.apache.kafka.common.network.Selector.doConnect(Selector.java:233) ~[kafka-clients-2.0.0.jar:na]     ... 7 common frames omitted  </code>  </pre>     <strong> Question: </strong>  How to connect to Kafka running in Docker? My code is running from host machine, not Docker.     Note: I know that I could theoretically play around with DNS setup and  <code> /etc/hosts </code>  but it is a workaround - it shouldn't be like that.    There is also similar question  <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/q/32302444/2065796'> here </a> , however it is based on  <code> ches/kafka </code>  image. I use  <code> confluentinc </code>  based image which is not the same.  
 I updated to the latest OS, and/or restarted my computer (this happens on every major update, but this time all I did was restart my computer on 2022-09-13)   This morning I navigated to my work's codebase in the Command Line on my MacBook pro, typed in "git status" in the repository and received an error:   (IN 9/2022, this error was much different, but I didn't capture it)   <blockquote>   xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun   </blockquote>   git will not work!   How do I fix git, and command line tools?  
 For my application, the memory used by the Java process is much more than the heap size.    The system where the containers are running starts to have memory problem because the container is taking much more memory than the heap size.    The heap size is set to 128 MB ( <code> -Xmx128m -Xms128m </code> ) while the container takes up to 1GB of memory. Under normal condition, it needs 500MB. If the docker container has a limit below (e.g.  <code> mem_limit=mem_limit=400MB </code> ) the process gets killed by the out of memory killer of the OS.     <strong> Could you explain why the Java process is using much more memory than the heap? How to size correctly the Docker memory limit? Is there a way to reduce the off-heap memory footprint of the Java process? </strong>     <hr>    I gather some details about the issue using command from  <a href='https://gist.github.com/prasanthj/48e7063cac88eb396bc9961fb3149b58' rel='noreferrer'> Native memory tracking in JVM </a> .

 I'm trying to make the ::backdrop pseudo-element of my dialog component using CSS. I've been able to achieve it on Edge and Chrome, but it seems like Firefox is not correctly applying the transition.   Does anyone know if that's not supported in FF, or my code is just wrong ? The modal itself respects the opacity transition, it's just the ::backdrop pseudo-element that comes up instantly.   This is the code I used for a quick proof of concept:   <pre>  <code> <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en">  <head>     <meta charset="UTF-8">     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">     <title>Dialog PoC</title>     <style>         dialog {             opacity: 0;             transition: opacity cubic-bezier(0.35, 0, 0.2, 1) 2s;         }          dialog.active {             opacity: 1;         }          dialog::backdrop {             background: black;             transition: opacity cubic-bezier(0.35, 0, 0.2, 1) 2s;             opacity: 0;         }          dialog.active::backdrop {             opacity: 0.8;         }     </style> </head>  <body>     <dialog>         <p>test nice</p>         <button id="closeBtn">close dialog</button>     </dialog>     <button id="openBtn">         open dialog     </button>      <script>         const dialog = document.querySelector('dialog')         const openBtn = document.querySelector('#openBtn')         const closeBtn = document.querySelector('#closeBtn')          openBtn.addEventListener('click', open)         closeBtn.addEventListener('click', close)           function open() {             dialog.showModal()             dialog.classList.add('active')         }         function close() {             dialog.close()             dialog.classList.remove('active')         }     </script> </body>  </html>  </code>  </pre>
