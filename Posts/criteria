AS smells paper criterions adapted to misconfigs
If a post contained at least one sentence which met one criterion they used it

labelling as positives:
C1: descritpion of misconfigs, Descriptions of misconfigs by practitioners based on their understanding, configuration files
C2: cause that lead to misconfigs / presence of error messages by author
C3: methods to resolve / prevent misconfig, answers to problem
C4: tools to resolve misconfig
C5: impact of misconfig on user's system
C6: challenges in detecting/resolving misconfig

more possible criteria for positives:
CA: Should the post include answers (or approved answers)?

labelling as negatives:
C7: not misconfig related topics, post is not about config errors, may include "configuration" in terms of settings for applications
e.g. "configuring home screen of application" etc
Completely unrelated or with configuration terms not related to misconfigs?
Three collections:
- related to configurations but not misconfigs
- not related to configurations, from top posts of all SoF
- not related to configurations, random picks

author's approach to data collection:
1. extract the URLs of the labelled posts
2. remove useless URL information in the posts (e.g., http://www.xxx.org/)
3. parse and extract post information (i.e., titles, questions, and answers)
4. save the post information into a CSV document
