<p>When looking beyond the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_application_development' rel='noreferrer'>RAD</a> (drag-drop and configure) way of building user interfaces that many tools encourage you are likely to come across three design patterns called <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Controller</a>, <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-Presenter</a> and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_View_ViewModel' rel='noreferrer'>Model-View-ViewModel</a>.

<p>How do I easily undo a git rebase? A lengthy manual method is:</p> <ol> <li>checkout the commit parent to both of the branches</li> <li>create and checkout a temporary branch</li> <li>cherry-pick all commits by hand</li> <li>reset the faulty rebased branch to point to the temporary branch</li> </ol> <p>In my current situation, this works because I can easily spot commits from both branches (one was my stuff, the other was my colleague's stuff). However, my approach strikes me as suboptimal and error-prone (let's say I had just rebased with two of my own branches).</p> <p>Clarification: I am talking about a rebase during which <em>multiple</em> commits were replayed, not only one.</p>

<p>How do I make the first character of a string uppercase if it's a letter, but not change the case of any of the other letters?</p> <p>For example:</p> <ul> <li><code>"this is a test"</code> → <code>"This is a test"</code></li> <li><code>"the Eiffel Tower"</code> → <code>"The Eiffel Tower"</code></li> <li><code>"/index.html"</code> → <code>"/index.html"</code></li> </ul>

<p>Recently, I ran some of my JavaScript code through Crockford's <a href='http://www.jslint.com/' rel='noreferrer'>JSLint</a>, and it gave the following error:</p> <blockquote> <p>Problem at line 1 character 1: Missing "use strict" statement.</p> </blockquote> <p>Doing some searching, I realized that some people add <code>"use strict";</code> into their JavaScript code. Once I added the statement, the error stopped appearing. Unfortunately, Google did not reveal much of the history behind this string statement. Certainly it must have something to do with how the JavaScript is interpreted by the browser, but I have no idea what the effect would be.</p> <p>So what is <code>"use strict";</code> all about, what does it imply, and is it still relevant?</p> <p>Do any of the current browsers respond to the <code>"use strict";</code> string or is it for future use?</p>

<p>Optimizing SQLite is tricky. Bulk-insert performance of a C application can vary from 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</p> <p><strong>Background:</strong> We are using SQLite as part of a desktop application. We have large amounts of configuration data stored in XML files that are parsed and loaded into an SQLite database for further processing when the application is initialized. SQLite is ideal for this situation because it's fast, it requires no specialized configuration, and the database is stored on disk as a single file.</p> <p><strong>Rationale:</strong> <em>Initially I was disappointed with the performance I was seeing.</em> It turns-out that the performance of SQLite can vary significantly (both for bulk-inserts and selects) depending on how the database is configured and how you're using the API. It was not a trivial matter to figure out what all of the options and techniques were, so I thought it prudent to create this community wiki entry to share the results with Stack Overflow readers in order to save others the trouble of the same investigations.</p> <p><strong>The Experiment:</strong> Rather than simply talking about performance tips in the general sense (i.e. <em>"Use a transaction!"</em>), I thought it best to write some C code and <em>actually measure</em> the impact of various options. We're going to start with some simple data:</p> <ul> <li>A 28 MB TAB-delimited text file (approximately 865,000 records) of the <a href='https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-routes-and-schedules/' rel='noreferrer'>complete transit schedule for the city of Toronto</a></li> <li>My test machine is a 3.60 GHz P4 running Windows XP.</li> <li>The code is compiled with <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_C%2B%2B#32-bit_versions' rel='noreferrer'>Visual C++</a> 2005 as "Release" with "Full Optimization" (/Ox) and Favor Fast Code (/Ot).</li> <li>I'm using the SQLite "Amalgamation", compiled directly into my test application. The SQLite version I happen to have is a bit older (3.6.7), but I suspect these results will be comparable to the latest release (please leave a comment if you think otherwise).</li> </ul> <p><em>Let's write some code!</em></p> <p><strong>The Code:</strong> A simple C program that reads the text file line-by-line, splits the string into values and then inserts the data into an SQLite database. In this "baseline" version of the code, the database is created, but we won't actually insert data:</p> <pre><code>/*************************************************************     Baseline code to experiment with SQLite performance.

We can do 920,000 inserts per second, provided we don't actually do any inserts :-)</p> <hr /> <h2>The "Worst-Case-Scenario"</h2> <p>We're going to generate the SQL string using the values read from the file and invoke that SQL operation using sqlite3_exec:</p> <pre><code>sprintf(sSQL, "INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s', '%s')", sRT, sBR, sVR, sST, sVI, sDT, sTM); sqlite3_exec(db, sSQL, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); </code></pre> <p>This is going to be slow because the SQL will be compiled into VDBE code for every insert and every insert will happen in its own transaction. <em>How slow?</em></p> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 9933.61 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>Yikes! 2 hours and 45 minutes! That's only <strong>85 inserts per second.</strong></p> <h2>Using a Transaction</h2> <p>By default, SQLite will evaluate every INSERT / UPDATE statement within a unique transaction. If performing a large number of inserts, it's advisable to wrap your operation in a transaction:</p> <pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);  pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r"); while (!feof(pFile)) {      ...  } fclose (pFile);  sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 38.03 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>That's better. Simply wrapping all of our inserts in a single transaction improved our performance to <strong>23,000 inserts per second.</strong></p> <h2>Using a Prepared Statement</h2> <p>Using a transaction was a huge improvement, but recompiling the SQL statement for every insert doesn't make sense if we using the same SQL over-and-over. Let's use <code>sqlite3_prepare_v2</code> to compile our SQL statement once and then bind our parameters to that statement using <code>sqlite3_bind_text</code>:</p> <pre><code>/* Open input file and import into the database */ cStartClock = clock();  sprintf(sSQL, "INSERT INTO TTC VALUES (NULL, @RT, @BR, @VR, @ST, @VI, @DT, @TM)"); sqlite3_prepare_v2(db,  sSQL, BUFFER_SIZE, &stmt, &tail);  sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);  pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r"); while (!feof(pFile)) {      fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);      sRT = strtok (sInputBuf, "\t");   /* Get Route */     sBR = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Branch */     sVR = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Version */     sST = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Stop Number */     sVI = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Vehicle */     sDT = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Date */     sTM = strtok (NULL, "\t");        /* Get Time */      sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, sRT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, sBR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, sVR, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, sST, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, sVI, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, sDT, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, sTM, -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);      sqlite3_step(stmt);      sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);     sqlite3_reset(stmt);      n++; } fclose (pFile);  sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg);  printf("Imported %d records in %4.2f seconds\n", n, (clock() - cStartClock) / (double)CLOCKS_PER_SEC);  sqlite3_finalize(stmt); sqlite3_close(db);  return 0; </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 16.27 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>Nice! There's a little bit more code (don't forget to call <code>sqlite3_clear_bindings</code> and <code>sqlite3_reset</code>), but we've more than doubled our performance to <strong>53,000 inserts per second.</strong></p> <h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF</h2> <p>By default, SQLite will pause after issuing a OS-level write command. This guarantees that the data is written to the disk. By setting <code>synchronous = OFF</code>, we are instructing SQLite to simply hand-off the data to the OS for writing and then continue. There's a chance that the database file may become corrupted if the computer suffers a catastrophic crash (or power failure) before the data is written to the platter:</p> <pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */ sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db); sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.41 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>The improvements are now smaller, but we're up to <strong>69,600 inserts per second.</strong></p> <h2>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2> <p>Consider storing the rollback journal in memory by evaluating <code>PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</code>. Your transaction will be faster, but if you lose power or your program crashes during a transaction you database could be left in a corrupt state with a partially-completed transaction:</p> <pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */ sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db); sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.50 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>A little slower than the previous optimization at <strong>64,000 inserts per second.</strong></p> <h2>PRAGMA synchronous = OFF <em>and</em> PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY</h2> <p>Let's combine the previous two optimizations. It's a little more risky (in case of a crash), but we're just importing data (not running a bank):</p> <pre><code>/* Open the database and create the schema */ sqlite3_open(DATABASE, &db); sqlite3_exec(db, TABLE, NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA synchronous = OFF", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "PRAGMA journal_mode = MEMORY", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 12.00 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>Fantastic! We're able to do <strong>72,000 inserts per second.</strong></p> <h2>Using an In-Memory Database</h2> <p>Just for kicks, let's build upon all of the previous optimizations and redefine the database filename so we're working entirely in RAM:</p> <pre><code>#define DATABASE ":memory:" </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 10.94 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>It's not super-practical to store our database in RAM, but it's impressive that we can perform <strong>79,000 inserts per second.</strong></p> <h2>Refactoring C Code</h2> <p>Although not specifically an SQLite improvement, I don't like the extra <code>char*</code> assignment operations in the <code>while</code> loop. Let's quickly refactor that code to pass the output of <code>strtok()</code> directly into <code>sqlite3_bind_text()</code>, and let the compiler try to speed things up for us:</p> <pre><code>pFile = fopen (INPUTDATA,"r"); while (!feof(pFile)) {      fgets (sInputBuf, BUFFER_SIZE, pFile);      sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 1, strtok (sInputBuf, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT); /* Get Route */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 2, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Branch */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 3, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Version */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 4, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Stop Number */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 5, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Vehicle */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 6, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Date */     sqlite3_bind_text(stmt, 7, strtok (NULL, "\t"), -1, SQLITE_TRANSIENT);    /* Get Time */      sqlite3_step(stmt);        /* Execute the SQL Statement */     sqlite3_clear_bindings(stmt);    /* Clear bindings */     sqlite3_reset(stmt);        /* Reset VDBE */      n++; } fclose (pFile); </code></pre> <p><strong>Note: We are back to using a real database file. In-memory databases are fast, but not necessarily practical</strong></p> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 8.94 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>A slight refactoring to the string processing code used in our parameter binding has allowed us to perform <strong>96,700 inserts per second.</strong> I think it's safe to say that this is <em>plenty fast</em>. As we start to tweak other variables (i.e. page size, index creation, etc.) this will be our benchmark.</p> <hr /> <h2>Summary (so far)</h2> <p><em>I hope you're still with me!</em> The reason we started down this road is that bulk-insert performance varies so wildly with SQLite, and it's not always obvious what changes need to be made to speed-up our operation. Using the same compiler (and compiler options), the same version of SQLite and the same data we've optimized our code and our usage of SQLite to go <strong>from a worst-case scenario of 85 inserts per second to over 96,000 inserts per second!</strong></p> <hr /> <h2>CREATE INDEX then INSERT vs. INSERT then CREATE INDEX</h2> <p>Before we start measuring <code>SELECT</code> performance, we know that we'll be creating indices. It's been suggested in one of the answers below that when doing bulk inserts, it is faster to create the index after the data has been inserted (as opposed to creating the index first then inserting the data). Let's try:</p> <p><strong>Create Index then Insert Data</strong></p> <pre><code>sqlite3_exec(db, "CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "BEGIN TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); ... </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 18.13 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Insert Data then Create Index</strong></p> <pre><code>... sqlite3_exec(db, "END TRANSACTION", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); sqlite3_exec(db, "CREATE  INDEX 'TTC_Stop_Index' ON 'TTC' ('Stop')", NULL, NULL, &sErrMsg); </code></pre> <blockquote> <p>Imported 864913 records in 13.66 seconds</p> </blockquote> <p>As expected, bulk-inserts are slower if one column is indexed, but it does make a difference if the index is created after the data is inserted. Our no-index baseline is 96,000 inserts per second. <strong>Creating the index first then inserting data gives us 47,700 inserts per second, whereas inserting the data first then creating the index gives us 63,300 inserts per second.</strong></p> <hr /> <p>I'd gladly take suggestions for other scenarios to try... And will be compiling similar data for SELECT queries soon.</p>

I moved "origin" to a NAS and successfully tested cloning it from here.</p> <p>I would like to know if I can change the URI of "origin" in the settings of "local" so it will now pull from the NAS, and not from the USB key.</p> <p>For now, I can see two solutions:</p> <ul> <li><p>push everything to the USB origin, and copy it to the NAS again (implies a lot of work due to new commits to NAS origin);</p> </li> <li><p>add a new remote to "local" and delete the old one (I fear I'll break my history).</p> </li> </ul> 
<p>I have a class that contains an <code>enum</code> property, and upon serializing the object using <code>JavaScriptSerializer</code>, my json result contains the integer value of the enumeration rather than its <code>string</code> "name".  Is there a way to get the enum as a <code>string</code> in my json without having to create a custom <code>JavaScriptConverter</code>?  Perhaps there's an attribute that I could decorate the <code>enum</code> definition, or object property, with?</p> <p>As an example:</p> <pre><code>enum Gender { Male, Female }  class Person {     int Age { get; set; }     Gender Gender { get; set; } } </code></pre> <p>Desired JSON result:</p> <pre><code>{ "Age": 35, "Gender": "Male" } </code></pre> <p>Ideally looking for answer with built-in .NET framework classes, if not possible alternatives (like Json.net) are welcome.</p> 
<p>I am making the effort to learn Vim.</p>  <p>When I paste code into my document from the clipboard, I get extra spaces at the start of each new line:</p>  <pre><code>line   line     line </code></pre>  <p>I know you can turn off auto indent but I can't get it to work because I have some other settings conflicting or something (which look pretty obvious in my .vimrc but don't seem to matter when I take them out). </p>  <p>How do I turn off auto indenting when I paste code but still have vim auto indent when I am writing code?  Here is my <code>.vimrc</code> file:</p>  <pre><code>set expandtab   set tabstop=2   set shiftwidth=2   set autoindent   set smartindent   set bg=dark   set nowrap   </code></pre>

<p>Why does Google prepend <code>while(1);</code> to their (private) JSON responses?</p>  <p>For example, here's a response while turning a calendar on and off in <a href='https://calendar.google.com/calendar/about/' rel='noreferrer'>Google Calendar</a>:</p>  <pre><code>while (1); [   ['u', [     ['smsSentFlag', 'false'],     ['hideInvitations', 'false'],     ['remindOnRespondedEventsOnly', 'true'],     ['hideInvitations_remindOnRespondedEventsOnly', 'false_true'],     ['Calendar ID stripped for privacy', 'false'],     ['smsVerifiedFlag', 'true']   ]] ] </code></pre>  <p>I would assume this is to prevent people from doing an <code>eval()</code> on it, but all you'd really have to do is replace the <code>while</code> and then you'd be set. I would assume the eval prevention is to make sure people write safe JSON parsing code.</p>  <p>I've seen this used in a couple of other places, too, but a lot more so with Google (Mail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.) Strangely enough, <a href='https://www.google.com/docs/about/' rel='noreferrer'>Google Docs</a> starts with <code>&&&START&&&</code> instead, and Google Contacts seems to start with <code>while(1); &&&START&&&</code>.</p>  <p>What's going on here?</p> 
<p>I've started playing with Git and have come across the terms 'upstream' and 'downstream'.  I've seen these before but never understood them fully.

<p>In my <code>~/.gitconfig</code>, I list my personal email address under <code>[user]</code>, since that's what I want to use for Github repos.</p>  <p>But, I've recently started using git for work, too. My company's git repo allows me to commit, but when it sends out announcements of new changesets, it says they are from Anonymous because it doesn't recognize the email address in my <code>.gitconfig</code> - at least, that's my theory.</p>  <p>Is it possible to specify multiple <code>[user]</code> definitions in <code>.gitconfig</code>? Or is there some other way to override the default <code>.gitconfig</code> for a certain directory? In my case, I check out all work code in <code>~/worksrc/</code> - is there a way to specify a <code>.gitconfig</code> for only that directory (and its subdirectories)?</p>

<p>Is there an SQL injection possibility even when using <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> function?</p>  <p>Consider this sample situation. SQL is constructed in PHP like this:</p>  <pre><code>$login = mysql_real_escape_string(GetFromPost('login')); $password = mysql_real_escape_string(GetFromPost('password'));  $sql = 'SELECT * FROM table WHERE login='$login' AND password='$password''; </code></pre>  <p>I have heard numerous people say to me that code like that is still dangerous and possible to hack even with <code>mysql_real_escape_string()</code> function used. But I cannot think of any possible exploit?</p>  <p>Classic injections like this:</p>  <pre><code>aaa' OR 1=1 -- </code></pre>  <p>do not work.</p>  <p>Do you know of any possible injection that would get through the PHP code above?</p>

<p>I have been working on a few Node apps, and I've been looking for a good pattern of storing deployment-related settings. In the Django world (where I come from), the common practise would be to have a <code>settings.py</code> file containing the standard settings (timezone, etc), and then a <code>local_settings.py</code> for deployment specific settings, ie. what database to talk to, what memcache socket, e-mail address for the admins and so on.</p>  <p>I have been looking for similar patterns for Node. Just a config file would be nice, so it does not have to be jammed in with everything else in <code>app.js</code>, but I find it important to have a way to have server-specific configuration in a file that is not in source control. The same app could well be deployed across different servers with wildly different settings, and having to deal with merge conflicts and all that is not my idea of fun.</p>  <p>So is there some kind of framework/tool for this, or does everyone just hack something together themselves?</p>

<p>I create a new branch in Git:</p>  <pre><code>git branch my_branch </code></pre>  <p>Push it:</p>  <pre><code>git push origin my_branch </code></pre>  <p>Now say someone made some changes on the server and I want to pull from <code>origin/my_branch</code>. I do:</p>  <pre><code>git pull </code></pre>  <p>But I get:</p>  <pre><code>You asked me to pull without telling me which branch you want to merge with, and 'branch.my_branch.merge' in your configuration file does not tell me, either. Please specify which branch you want to use on the command line and try again (e.g. 'git pull <repository> <refspec>'). See git-pull(1) for details.  If you often merge with the same branch, you may want to use something like the following in your configuration file:      [branch 'my_branch']     remote = <nickname>     merge = <remote-ref>      [remote '<nickname>']     url = <url>     fetch = <refspec>  See git-config(1) for details. </code></pre>  <p>I learned that I can make it work with:</p>  <pre><code>git branch --set-upstream my_branch origin/my_branch </code></pre>  <p>But why do I need to do this for every branch I create? Isn't it obvious that if I push <code>my_branch</code> into <code>origin/my_branch</code>, then I would want to pull <code>origin/my_branch</code> into <code>my_branch</code>? How can I make this the default behavior?</p>

<p>I wrote some code for testing the impact of try-catch, but seeing some surprising results.</p>  <pre><code>static void Main(string[] args) {     Thread.CurrentThread.Priority = ThreadPriority.Highest;     Process.GetCurrentProcess().PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.RealTime;      long start = 0, stop = 0, elapsed = 0;     double avg = 0.0;      long temp = Fibo(1);      for (int i = 1; i < 100000000; i++)     {         start = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();         temp = Fibo(100);         stop = Stopwatch.GetTimestamp();          elapsed = stop - start;         avg = avg + ((double)elapsed - avg) / i;     }      Console.WriteLine('Elapsed: ' + avg);     Console.ReadKey(); }  static long Fibo(int n) {     long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;     n++;      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)     {         n1 = n2;         n2 = fibo;         fibo = n1 + n2;     }      return fibo; } </code></pre>  <p>On my computer, this consistently prints out a value around 0.96..</p>  <p>When I wrap the for loop inside Fibo() with a try-catch block like this:</p>  <pre><code>static long Fibo(int n) {     long n1 = 0, n2 = 1, fibo = 0;     n++;      try     {         for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)         {             n1 = n2;             n2 = fibo;             fibo = n1 + n2;         }     }     catch {}      return fibo; } </code></pre>  <p>Now it consistently prints out 0.69... -- it actually runs faster! But why?</p>  <p>Note: I compiled this using the Release configuration and directly ran the EXE file (outside Visual Studio).</p>  <p>EDIT: <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/a/8928476/282110'>Jon Skeet's <em>excellent</em> analysis</a> shows that try-catch is somehow causing the x86 CLR to use the CPU registers in a more favorable way in this specific case (and I think we're yet to understand why). I confirmed Jon's finding that x64 CLR doesn't have this difference, and that it was faster than the x86 CLR. I also tested using <code>int</code> types inside the Fibo method instead of <code>long</code> types, and then the x86 CLR was as equally fast as the x64 CLR.</p>  <hr>  <p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> It looks like this issue has been fixed by Roslyn. Same machine, same CLR version -- the issue remains as above when compiled with VS 2013, but the problem goes away when compiled with VS 2015. </p>

<p>Yesterday I was pairing the socks from the clean laundry and figured out the way I was doing it is not very efficient.

Sorting (according to size/color/...) of course came to mind to achieve an O(NlogN) solution.</p>  <p>Hashing or other not-in-place solutions are not an option, because I am not able to duplicate my socks (though it could be nice if I could).</p>  <p><strong>So, the question is basically:</strong></p>  <p>Given a pile of <code>n</code> pairs of socks, containing <code>2n</code> elements (assume each sock has exactly one matching pair), what is the best way to pair them up efficiently with up to logarithmic extra space?

Even if you have the IP address of the docker host it does not mean you can connect to docker host from within the container given that IP address as your Docker network may be overlay, host, bridge, macvlan, none etc which restricts the reachability of that IP address.</p> 
<p>I tried working with Apiary and made a universal template to send JSON to mock server and have this code:</p>  <pre><code>package main  import (     'encoding/json'     'fmt'     'github.com/jmcvetta/napping'     'log'     'net/http' )  func main() {     url := 'http://restapi3.apiary.io/notes'     fmt.Println('URL:>', url)      s := napping.Session{}     h := &http.Header{}     h.Set('X-Custom-Header', 'myvalue')     s.Header = h      var jsonStr = []byte(` {     'title': 'Buy cheese and bread for breakfast.' }`)      var data map[string]json.RawMessage     err := json.Unmarshal(jsonStr, &data)     if err != nil {         fmt.Println(err)     }      resp, err := s.Post(url, &data, nil, nil)     if err != nil {         log.Fatal(err)     }     fmt.Println('response Status:', resp.Status())     fmt.Println('response Headers:', resp.HttpResponse().Header)     fmt.Println('response Body:', resp.RawText())  } </code></pre>  <p>This code doesn't send JSON properly, but I don't know why. The JSON string can be different in every call. I can't use <code>Struct</code> for this.</p> 
<p>How can I print (to the console) the <code>Id</code>, <code>Title</code>, <code>Name</code>, etc. of this struct in Golang?</p> <pre><code>type Project struct {     Id      int64   `json:"project_id"`     Title   string  `json:"title"`     Name    string  `json:"name"`     Data    Data    `json:"data"`     Commits Commits `json:"commits"` } </code></pre>

<p>What is the best way to create and use a struct with only one instantiation in the system? Yes, this is necessary, it is the OpenGL subsystem, and making multiple copies of this and passing it around everywhere would add confusion, rather than relieve it.</p> <p>The singleton needs to be as efficient as possible. It doesn't seem possible to store an arbitrary object on the static area, as it contains a <code>Vec</code> with a destructor. The second option is to store an (unsafe) pointer on the static area, pointing to a heap allocated singleton. What is the most convenient and safest way to do this, while keeping syntax terse?</p> 
<p>I'm running Jenkins inside a Docker container. I wonder if it's ok for the Jenkins container to also be a Docker host? What I'm thinking about is to start a new docker container for each integration test build from inside Jenkins (to start databases, message brokers etc). The containers should thus be shutdown after the integration tests are completed. Is there a reason to avoid running docker containers from inside another docker container in this way?</p> 
<p>I'm now trying to assign a static IP 172.17.0.1 when a Docker container be started up. </p>  <p>I use port 2122 as the ssh port of this container so that I let this container listen port 2122.</p>  <pre><code>sudo docker run -i -t -p 2122:2122 ubuntu </code></pre>  <p>This command will run a Docker container with a random IP like 172.17.0.5, but I need to assign a specific IP to the container.</p>  <p>The following shell script is what I reference Docker documentation in advanced network settings.</p>  <pre><code>pid=$(sudo docker inspect -f '{{.State.Pid}}' <container_name> 2>/dev/null) sudo rm -rf /var/run/netns/* sudo ln -s /proc/$pid/ns/net /var/run/netns/$pid sudo ip link add A type veth peer name B sudo brctl addif docker0 A sudo ip link set A up sudo ip link set B netns $pid sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 down sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link delete eth0 sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set dev B name eth0 sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 address 12:34:56:78:9a:bc sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 down sudo ip netns exec $pid ip link set eth0 up sudo ip netns exec $pid ip addr add 172.17.0.1/16 dev eth0 sudo ip netns exec $pid ip route add default via 172.17.42.1 </code></pre>  <p>This shell script will assign a static IP 172.17.0.1 and link to the world fine.

<p>I'm learning/experimenting with Rust, and in all the elegance that I find in this language, there is one peculiarity that baffles me and seems totally out of place.</p>  <p>Rust automatically dereferences pointers when making method calls.

<p>Supposed I have a Docker container and a folder on my host <code>/hostFolder</code>.

I want to exclude this, and I also want the Docker container be able to make changes to this sub-folder, without the consequence of having it changed on the host as well.</p>  <p>Is this possible? If so, how?</p> 
<p>There are several questions that seem to be about the same problem I'm having. For example see <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24542064/why-does-the-variable-not-live-long-enough'>here</a> and <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26435791/as-slice-produces-not-live-enough-error'>here</a>. Basically I'm trying to build a <code>String</code> in a local function, but then return it as a <code>&str</code>. Slicing isn't working because the lifetime is too short. I can't use <code>str</code> directly in the function because I need to build it dynamically. However, I'd also prefer not to return a <code>String</code> since the nature of the object this is going into is static once it's built. Is there a way to have my cake and eat it too?</p>  <p>Here's a minimal non-compiling reproduction:</p>  <pre><code>fn return_str<'a>() -> &'a str {     let mut string = ''.to_string();      for i in 0..10 {         string.push_str('ACTG');     }      &string[..] } </code></pre>

<p>I'm having a problem with trying to use Angular's <code>*ngFor</code> and <code>*ngIf</code> on the same element. </p>  <p>When trying to loop through the collection in the <code>*ngFor</code>, the collection is seen as <code>null</code> and consequently fails when trying to access its properties in the template.</p>  <pre class='lang-ts prettyprint-override'><code>@Component({   selector: 'shell',   template: `     <h3>Shell</h3><button (click)='toggle()'>Toggle!</button>      <div *ngIf='show' *ngFor='let thing of stuff'>       {{log(thing)}}       <span>{{thing.name}}</span>     </div>   ` })  export class ShellComponent implements OnInit {    public stuff:any[] = [];   public show:boolean = false;    constructor() {}    ngOnInit() {     this.stuff = [       { name: 'abc', id: 1 },       { name: 'huo', id: 2 },       { name: 'bar', id: 3 },       { name: 'foo', id: 4 },       { name: 'thing', id: 5 },       { name: 'other', id: 6 },     ]   }    toggle() {     this.show = !this.show;   }    log(thing) {     console.log(thing);   }  } </code></pre>  <p>I know the easy solution is to move the <code>*ngIf</code> up a level but for scenarios like looping over list items in a <code>ul</code>, I'd end up with either an empty <code>li</code> if the collection is empty, or my <code>li</code>s wrapped in redundant container elements.</p>  <p>Example at this <a href='http://plnkr.co/edit/C5tZ8mD3iWczVvWkWycH?p=preview' rel='noreferrer'>plnkr</a>.</p>  <p>Note the console error:</p>  <pre><code>EXCEPTION: TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null in [{{thing.name}} in ShellComponent@5:12] </code></pre>  <p>Am I doing something wrong or is this a bug?</p>

<p>I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>  <ul> <li><code>npm</code> & <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li> <li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which does it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).</li> <li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li> <li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li> <li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li> <li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. 'on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp').</li> <li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href='https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/' rel='noreferrer'>AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li> </ul>  <p><strong><em>Questions:</em></strong></p>  <ol> <li><em>What is <code>webpack</code> & <code>webpack-dev-server</code>?</em> Official documentation says it's a module bundler but for me it's just a task runner. <em>What's the difference?</em></li> <li><em>Where would you use <code>browserify</code>? Can't we do the same with node/ES6 imports?</em> </li> <li><em>When would you use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins?</em></li> <li><em>Please provide examples when you need to use a combination</em></li> </ol>

<p>I am a bit confused about how to get the <code>key</code> and <code>value</code> of an object in angular2 while using <code>*ngFor</code> for iterating over the object.

I have tried something similar, without success:</p>  <pre class='lang-html prettyprint-override'><code>    <ul>       <li *ngFor='#key of demo'>{{key}}</li>     </ul>      demo = {         'key1': [{'key11':'value11'}, {'key12':'value12'}],         'key2': [{'key21':'value21'}, {'key22':'value22'}],       } </code></pre>  <p>Here is a plnkr with my attempt: <a href='http://plnkr.co/edit/mIj619FncOpfdwrR0KeG?p=preview' rel='noreferrer'>http://plnkr.co/edit/mIj619FncOpfdwrR0KeG?p=preview</a></p>  <p>How can I get <code>key1</code> and <code>key2</code> dynamically using <code>*ngFor</code>? After searching extensively, I found the idea of using pipes but I don't know how to go about it. Is there any inbuilt pipe for doing the same in angular2?</p> 
<p>Angular provides life cycle hook <code>ngOnInit</code> by default.</p>  <p>Why should <code>ngOnInit</code> be used, if we already have a <code>constructor</code>?</p> 
<p>There are many cases using <strong>nil</strong> in golang. For example:</p>  <pre><code>func (u *URL) Parse(ref string) (*URL, error) {     refurl, err := Parse(ref)     if err != nil {         return nil, err     }     return u.ResolveReference(refurl), nil } </code></pre>  <p>but we can't use it like this:</p>  <pre><code>var str string //or var str int str = nil </code></pre>  <p>the golang compiler will throw a <code>can't use nil as type string in assignment</code> error.</p>  <p>Looks like <code>nil</code> can only be used for a pointer of struct and interface. If that is the case, then <strong>what does it mean?</strong> and <strong>when we use it to compare to the other object, how do they compare, in other words, how does golang determine one object is nil</strong>?</p>  <p><strong>EDIT:For example, if an interface is nil, its type and value must be nil at the same time. How does golang do this?</strong></p> 
<p>I've read questions like <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36059564/access-eventemitter-service-inside-of-customhttp'>Access EventEmitter Service inside of CustomHttp</a> where the user uses EventEmitter in his service, but he was suggested in this <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36059564/access-eventemitter-service-inside-of-customhttp#comment59766410_36059564'>comment</a> not to use it and to use instead Observables directly in his services.</p> <p>I also read this <a href='https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36014395/angular-2-two-way-communication-between-components/36014451#36014451'>question</a> where the solution suggests to pass the EventEmitter to the child and subscribe to it.</p> <p>My question then is: Should I, or should I not subscribe manually to an EventEmitter?

<p>By using Http, we call a method that does a network call and returns an http observable:</p>    <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'><code>getCustomer() {     return this.http.get('/someUrl').map(res => res.json()); } </code></pre>  <p>If we take this observable and add multiple subscribers to it:</p>  <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'><code>let network$ = getCustomer();  let subscriber1 = network$.subscribe(...); let subscriber2 = network$.subscribe(...); </code></pre>  <p>What we want to do, is ensure that this does not cause multiple network requests.</p>  <p>This might seem like an unusual scenario, but its actually quite common: for example if the caller subscribes to the observable to display an error message, and passes it to the template using the async pipe, we already have two subscribers.</p>  <p>What is the correct way of doing that in RxJs 5? </p>  <p>Namely, this seems to work fine:</p>  <pre class='lang-js prettyprint-override'><code>getCustomer() {     return this.http.get('/someUrl').map(res => res.json()).share(); } </code></pre>  <p>But is this the idiomatic way of doing this in RxJs 5, or should we do something else instead? </p>  <p><em>Note : As per Angular 5 new <code>HttpClient</code>, the <code>.map(res => res.json())</code> part in all examples is now useless, as JSON result is now assumed by default.</em></p>

<p>I'm trying to setup a tab system that allows for components to register themselves (with a title). The first tab is like an inbox, there's plenty of actions/link items to choose from for the users, and each of these clicks should be able to instantiate a new component, on click. The actions / links comes in from JSON.</p>  <p>The instantiated component will then register itself as a new tab.</p>  <p>I'm not sure if this is the 'best' approach? So far, the only guides I've seen are for static tabs, which doesn't help.</p>  <p>So far, I've only got the tabs service which is bootstrapped in main to persist throughout the app. It looks something like this:</p>  <pre><code>export interface ITab { title: string; }  @Injectable() export class TabsService {     private tabs = new Set<ITab>();      addTab(title: string): ITab {         let tab: ITab = { title };         this.tabs.add(tab);         return tab;     }      removeTab(tab: ITab) {         this.tabs.delete(tab);     } } </code></pre>  <p>Questions:</p>  <ol> <li>How can I have a dynamic list in the inbox that creates new (different) tabs? I am sort of guessing the <code>DynamicComponentBuilder</code> would be used?</li> <li>How can the components be created from the inbox (on click) register themselves as tabs and also be shown? I'm guessing <code>ng-content</code>, but I can't find much info on how to use it</li> </ol>  <p><strong>EDIT:</strong> An attempt to clarify.</p>  <p>Think of the inbox as a mail inbox. Items are fetched as JSON and it displays several items. Once one of the items is clicked, a new tab is created with that items action 'type'. The type is then a component.</p>  <p><strong>EDIT 2:</strong> <a href='https://i.imgur.com/yzfMOXJ.png' rel='noreferrer'>Image</a>.</p>

<p>I updated to the latest OS, and/or restarted my computer (this happens on every major update, but this time all I did was restart my computer on 2022-09-13)</p> <p>This morning I navigated to my work's codebase in the Command Line on my MacBook pro, typed in "git status" in the repository and received an error:</p> <p>(IN 9/2022, this error was much different, but I didn't capture it)</p> <blockquote> <p>xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun</p> </blockquote> <p>git will not work!</p> <p>How do I fix git, and command line tools?</p> 
<p>For my application, the memory used by the Java process is much more than the heap size.</p>  <p>The system where the containers are running starts to have memory problem because the container is taking much more memory than the heap size.</p>  <p>The heap size is set to 128 MB (<code>-Xmx128m -Xms128m</code>) while the container takes up to 1GB of memory. Under normal condition, it needs 500MB. If the docker container has a limit below (e.g. <code>mem_limit=mem_limit=400MB</code>) the process gets killed by the out of memory killer of the OS.</p>  <p><strong>Could you explain why the Java process is using much more memory than the heap? How to size correctly the Docker memory limit? Is there a way to reduce the off-heap memory footprint of the Java process?</strong></p>  <hr>  <p>I gather some details about the issue using command from <a href='https://gist.github.com/prasanthj/48e7063cac88eb396bc9961fb3149b58' rel='noreferrer'>Native memory tracking in JVM</a>.</p>  <p>From the host system, I get the memory used by the container.</p>  <pre><code>$ docker stats --no-stream 9afcb62a26c8 CONTAINER ID        NAME                                                                                        CPU %               MEM USAGE / LIMIT   MEM %               NET I/O             BLOCK I/O           PIDS 9afcb62a26c8        xx-xxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.0acbb46bb6fe3ae1b1c99aff3a6073bb7b7ecf85   0.93%               461MiB / 9.744GiB   4.62%               286MB / 7.92MB      157MB / 2.66GB      57 </code></pre>  <p>From inside the container, I get the memory used by the process.</p>  <pre><code>$ ps -p 71 -o pcpu,rss,size,vsize %CPU   RSS  SIZE    VSZ 11.2 486040 580860 3814600 </code></pre>  <hr>  <pre><code>$ jcmd 71 VM.native_memory 71:  Native Memory Tracking:  Total: reserved=1631932KB, committed=367400KB -                 Java Heap (reserved=131072KB, committed=131072KB)                             (mmap: reserved=131072KB, committed=131072KB)   -                     Class (reserved=1120142KB, committed=79830KB)                             (classes #15267)                             (  instance classes #14230, array classes #1037)                             (malloc=1934KB #32977)                              (mmap: reserved=1118208KB, committed=77896KB)                              (  Metadata:   )                             (    reserved=69632KB, committed=68272KB)                             (    used=66725KB)                             (    free=1547KB)                             (    waste=0KB =0.00%)                             (  Class space:)                             (    reserved=1048576KB, committed=9624KB)                             (    used=8939KB)                             (    free=685KB)                             (    waste=0KB =0.00%)  -                    Thread (reserved=24786KB, committed=5294KB)                             (thread #56)                             (stack: reserved=24500KB, committed=5008KB)                             (malloc=198KB #293)                              (arena=88KB #110)  -                      Code (reserved=250635KB, committed=45907KB)                             (malloc=2947KB #13459)                              (mmap: reserved=247688KB, committed=42960KB)   -                        GC (reserved=48091KB, committed=48091KB)                             (malloc=10439KB #18634)                              (mmap: reserved=37652KB, committed=37652KB)   -                  Compiler (reserved=358KB, committed=358KB)                             (malloc=249KB #1450)                              (arena=109KB #5)  -                  Internal (reserved=1165KB, committed=1165KB)                             (malloc=1125KB #3363)                              (mmap: reserved=40KB, committed=40KB)   -                     Other (reserved=16696KB, committed=16696KB)                             (malloc=16696KB #35)   -                    Symbol (reserved=15277KB, committed=15277KB)                             (malloc=13543KB #180850)                              (arena=1734KB #1)  -    Native Memory Tracking (reserved=4436KB, committed=4436KB)                             (malloc=378KB #5359)                              (tracking overhead=4058KB)  -        Shared class space (reserved=17144KB, committed=17144KB)                             (mmap: reserved=17144KB, committed=17144KB)   -               Arena Chunk (reserved=1850KB, committed=1850KB)                             (malloc=1850KB)   -                   Logging (reserved=4KB, committed=4KB)                             (malloc=4KB #179)   -                 Arguments (reserved=19KB, committed=19KB)                             (malloc=19KB #512)   -                    Module (reserved=258KB, committed=258KB)                             (malloc=258KB #2356)   $ cat /proc/71/smaps | grep Rss | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' ' | cut -f1 -dk | sort -n | awk '{ sum += $1 } END { print sum }' 491080 </code></pre>  <p>The application is a web server using Jetty/Jersey/CDI bundled inside a fat far of 36 MB.</p>  <p>The following version of OS and Java are used (inside the container).

<p>I'm trying to make the ::backdrop pseudo-element of my dialog component using CSS. I've been able to achieve it on Edge and Chrome, but it seems like Firefox is not correctly applying the transition.</p> <p>Does anyone know if that's not supported in FF, or my code is just wrong ? The modal itself respects the opacity transition, it's just the ::backdrop pseudo-element that comes up instantly.</p> <p>This is the code I used for a quick proof of concept:</p> <pre><code><!DOCTYPE html> <html lang="en">  <head>     <meta charset="UTF-8">     <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">     <title>Dialog PoC</title>     <style>         dialog {             opacity: 0;             transition: opacity cubic-bezier(0.35, 0, 0.2, 1) 2s;         }          dialog.active {             opacity: 1;         }          dialog::backdrop {             background: black;             transition: opacity cubic-bezier(0.35, 0, 0.2, 1) 2s;             opacity: 0;         }          dialog.active::backdrop {             opacity: 0.8;         }     </style> </head>  <body>     <dialog>         <p>test nice</p>         <button id="closeBtn">close dialog</button>     </dialog>     <button id="openBtn">         open dialog     </button>      <script>         const dialog = document.querySelector('dialog')         const openBtn = document.querySelector('#openBtn')         const closeBtn = document.querySelector('#closeBtn')          openBtn.addEventListener('click', open)         closeBtn.addEventListener('click', close)           function open() {             dialog.showModal()             dialog.classList.add('active')         }         function close() {             dialog.close()             dialog.classList.remove('active')         }     </script> </body>  </html> </code></pre>
